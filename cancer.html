This is a very personal topic to many: nearly everyone knows or has lost someone dear to them from this collection of diseases.</p><p>Cancers are defined by the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/what-is-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Cancer Institute (NCI)</a> as a collection of diseases in which abnormal cells can divide and spread to nearby tissue. As this definition suggests, cancers can arise in many parts of the body (leading to a range of cancer types, as shown below) and in some cases spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div></section>

But is this really the case?</p><p>Whilst a crucial metric of total disease burden and mortality, the absolute number of deaths has two key caveats: it fails to account for changes in population size and age structure. As we have explored above, the majority of cancer deaths occur in those aged over 50 years old; this means we should expect the total number of cancer deaths to increase as a population ages. The drivers of rising <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy">life expectancy</a>, aging populations, and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#shares-by-world-regions">population growth</a> can compound to give a skewed perception of frequency.</p><p>A more useful metric in this regard is the age-standardized death rate. This metric corrects for the effects of changing age distributions by normalising to a fixed reference population structure (assumed the same across countries and with time), and for differences in population size by reporting as the number of deaths per 100,000 individuals.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p><p> The age-standardized death rate from all cancer types are shown in the visualization. This data can be explored through time using the &#x2018;play&#x2019; button at the bottom of the chart, and national time-series can be viewed by clicking on a respective country.</p><p>In 2017, we see that most countries have death rates of 50 to 150 deaths per 100,000 individuals. On average, higher-income countries tend to fall towards the upper band of this range; across North America, Europe, and Australasia, rates are typically close to 150 per 100,000. This is also true across a number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Rates across Latin America, Asia, and some parts of Africa are on average lower (50-125 per 100,000).<br></p><p>The number of cancer deaths can therefore be influenced by three key factors: an actual change in the prevalence of cancer, changes in population size, and changes in population age (since we see <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-death-rates-by-age">higher cancer death rates</a> in older individuals within a given population). In the chart we show an index of three variables since 1990: the total number of cancer deaths (this does not correct for population size or age); all ages death rate (which corrects for population size); and age-standardized death rate (which corrects for population size and aging). These trends are indexed to the year 1990, where all values in 1990 are equal to 100 (a value of 120, for example, would indicate a 20 percent increase since 1990; 60 would indicate a 40 percent reduction).</p><p>At a global level we see that total cancer deaths have increased more than 50 percent since 1990. However, when we correct for population size (all ages death rate), this increase is much smaller at just over 10 percent. Finally, once corrected for age, we see rates have actually fallen by 15-20 percent since 1990. In other words, the individual incidence of cancer deaths has actually fallen. These indexed trends are available to view by country in the chart using the &#x201C;Change country&#x201D; option.</p><p>The overall global trend nonetheless shows an often counter-intuitive finding: despite increasing numbers of cancer deaths, individual death rates are falling. In 1990, 161 people out of every 100,000 globally died from cancer&#xA0;&#x2014; by 2016 this <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-death-rates-per-100000?tab=chart&amp;country=OWID_WRL">had fallen</a> to 134 per 100,000.</p><p>For the purposes of assessing the total incidence of cancer, in the chart above we grouped all cancer types together to look at overall trends. However, death rates and progress in reducing mortality incidence varies across the many forms of cancer. In the chart we see the individual age-standardized death rates across cancer types. This is again measured as the number of deaths per 100,000 individuals.</p><p>As we would expect from the leading cause of cancer deaths, rates in tracheal, bronchus and lung cancer are highest globally at 24 per 100,000. This has fallen slightly from approximately 26 per 100,000 in 1990, with even greater declines in some countries (in the US, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-death-rates-by-type?country=USA">rates have fallen</a> from 47 to 34 per 100,000).</p><p>In some cases we have seen dramatic declines over the last few decades. For some, such as stomach cancer there has been notable progress&#xA0;&#x2014; declining from 19 to 11 deaths per 100,000.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The overall global trends on cancer mortality &#x2014; as summarised in data above&#xA0;&#x2014; tells a story which at first glance can seem conflicting.</p><p>The total number of deaths from cancer is increasing. This is predominantly a result of aging (and growing) populations. Once we correct the number of deaths for population size, we see that cancer death rates have approximately flatlined; then when further corrected for age we see that globally, death rates are falling. This represents progress, although very slow.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-death-rates-per-100000?tab=map" class="grapherPreview">

Another metric used to measure disease burden is Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). DALYs are used to measure total burden of disease &#x2013; both from years of life lost and years lived with a disability. One DALY equals one lost year of healthy life.</p><p>The chart shows age-standardized rates of DALYs from cancers, measured per 100,000 individuals. This is measured across all cancer types. Also shown are disease burden rates broken down by cancer types. We see that at a global level, the largest burden results from tracheal, bronchus and lung cancer, followed by liver, stomach, colon &amp; rectum, and breast cancer.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/disease-burden-rates-from-cancers" class="grapherPreview">

But it&#x2019;s also true that the world today has more people, and more <em>older</em> people, who are more likely to die from cancer. To understand what is happening we therefore have to correct for the population increase and ask for the rate &#x2013; the number of deaths per 100,000 people &#x2013; and we have to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_adjustment">adjust for ageing</a>.</p><p>When we compare these metrics (shown <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-deaths-rate-and-age-standardized-rate-index">here</a></strong>) we see that <strong>age-standardized&#xA0;cancer death rates are&#xA0;<em>falling&#xA0;</em>globally. </strong>Death rates which correct for ageing show a 17 percent decline from 1990 to 2016.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="five-year-survival-rates-have-increased"><a class="deep-link" href="#five-year-survival-rates-have-increased"></a>Five-year survival rates have increased</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Why are cancer death rates falling? One hypothesis is that cancer prevalence is falling (i.e. less people have cancer). Is this true?</p><p>Globally, no. The <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/cancer#global-perspective-on-cancer-prevalence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">share of people with cancer</a> (even when corrected for ageing) has been slowly increasing in recent decades. Global cancer prevalence has risen from 0.54 percent to 0.64 percent since 1990 (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/smoking#share-of-cancer-deaths-attributed-to-smoking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">largely due to smoking</a>). In some countries &#x2013; <strong><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-population-with-cancer?tab=chart&amp;country=USA">the US, for example</a></strong> &#x2013; the age-corrected prevalence has been fairly constant in recent decades (with the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-incidence?tab=chart&amp;country=USA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rate of <em>new </em>cases actually falling</a>).</p><p>If death rates are falling but prevalence is rising or constant, then it must be the case that people with cancer have better or longer survival rates. We see this clearly in the USA when we look at the change in five-year survival rates across cancer types. This is shown in the chart as the change from 1970-77 to 2007-2013.</p><p>Here we see that on aggregate five-year survival rates for all cancers increased from 50.3 to 67 percent. But we also see significant differences not only in start or end survival rates, but the change over time. Prostate cancer has close to 99 percent five-year survival, but has also seen major progress from a rate of 69 percent in the 1970s. In contrast, pancreas has low five-year survival rates at 8.2 percent, up from 2.5 percent.</p><p>There are two key factors which could contribute to improved five-year survival rates: earlier detection and/or improved treatment. Defining the exact attribution of each is difficult, and varies depending on cancer type. But there have been some studies which have attempted to do so.&#xA0;Scott Alexander published a very good overview of the relative impact of detection versus treatment <strong><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/08/01/cancer-progress-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/">here</a></strong>.</p><p>One way to test whether survival rates only increased from early diagnosis is to look at how survival has changed for <em>each stage</em> of cancer: if detection was the only improvement then we would see no increase in survival rates in later cancer stages. National cancer statistics published by the US government show increases in survival rate within all stages (from very early to late-stage).<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p>Other studies focused on specific cancer types show similar results.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p>Tumours have gotten smaller in recent decades &#x2013; the result of earlier detection. Studies have shown that this can account for a significant share of survival improvements: one study attributed early detection as&#xA0;61 percent and 28 percent of improved survival in localized-stage and regional-stage breast cancer, respectively<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a> But even when correcting for size and early detection, we have seen improvements.&#xA0;</p><p>This suggests better treatment has played a role too.</p><p>In both detection and treatment, we&#x2019;re seeing progress. This is important because of the large toll of cancer: Globally every sixth death is due to cancer &#x2013; this makes it the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-number-of-deaths-by-cause" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world&#x2019;s second largest cause of death</a>. Progress here is important for many. </p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><div class="wp-block-image">

In breast cancer, higher income countries in particular across North America, Europe and Oceania tend to have five-year survival rates over 80 percent.

The outcomes of such studies are highly important&#xA0;&#x2014; if genetic factors are found to be dominant then early detection and understanding of the relative vulnerability of different DNA and tissue variations arguably present the best opportunity to reduce cancer burden. In contrast, if external and environmental risk factors dominate, then lifestyle choice which reduces risk exposure is crucial for this reduction.</p><p>In a 2015 paper by Tomasetti &amp; Vogalstein in&#xA0;<em>Science</em>, the authors conclude that only one-third of cancers are attributable to environmental factors or inherited predispositions; the vast majority result from &#x201C;bad luck,&#x201D; that is the random mutations which can occur when DNA replicates in normal non-cancerous cells.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p> This study therefore argued that, beyond some cancer types which are deterministic (D-tumors) and can be reduced through lifestyle factors or vaccines, the most promising approach to reduction of cancer deaths across most cancers (replicative, R-tumors) is early detection.</p><p>This paper has been highly contest within the scientific literature. A number of later publications in&#xA0;<em>Science</em> provided a rebuttal to these conclusions, suggesting analytical flaws in the prior analysis, and epidemiological evidence which suggests otherwise.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p> Such studies have argue that the role of &#x2018;chance&#x2019; in cancer development was overstated by Tomasetti &amp; Vogelstein, and the role of environmental exposures was understated. Wu et al. (2016) published in&#xA0;a study in&#xA0;<em>Nature</em> which concluded that intrinsic factors (which relates to the &#x2018;bad luck&#x2019; DNA replication) account for less than 10-30 percent of cancer development, with the remaining (majority) share coming from extrinsic risk factors (which are external environmental exposures).<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>The IHME, Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study attempt&#xA0;&#x2014; using risk-exposure relationships&#xA0;&#x2014; to provide attribution of certain risk factors to disease burden and mortality outcomes.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a> These risk factors include a wide range, including smoking, diet and nutrition, obesity, alcohol intake, air pollution, &amp; environmental exposures, such as carcinogens.</p><p>In the chart we see IHME estimates of the share of global cancer deaths which are attributed to one of these major risk factors. For example, 84 percent of tracheal, bronchus and lung cancer deaths are attributed to risk factors such as smoking and air pollution. The remaining share of deaths we would therefore assume no attribution to risk factors, and would occur naturally in the absence of such risks (i.e. deaths from lung cancer which would result if no one smoked, zero air pollution etc.). Note that IHME risk factors do not account for sun exposure, which is a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/sun-uv-and-cancer/how-the-sun-and-uv-cause-cancer" target="_blank">known risk factor</a> for skin cancer.

However, in the charts we show five-year survival rates (following diagnosis), versus GDP per capita for countries with such data available.</p><p>As we see, this relationship can vary significantly depending on cancer type. Five-year survival rates from breast cancer typically show a positive relationship: an increase in average income tends to be correlated to an increase in breast cancer survival rates. This is particularly true at lower-to-middle incomes, with a tailing off towards high incomes. The relationship in lung cancer survival rate is less well-established.

<li>Cancer death rate: this reports the number of deaths per 100,000 individuals within a given population;</li>
<li>Age-standardized death rate: this reports the number of deaths per 100,000 individuals assuming a constant and consistent age-structure of population between countries and across time.</li>
</ul><p>These measures vary in the information they provide. Absolute (total) number of cancer deaths &amp; prevalence figures provide an important indication of the total cancer burden within a given country or society. This is an important metric for a number of reasons, including the need for management and provision of adequate health services (which is dependent on the total societal burden, not just the incidence or risk for a given individual).</p><p>However, total number of cancer deaths fails to correct for population size and age. Cancer deaths can therefore rise as a result of higher cancer prevalence and/or poorer treatment, but also due to an increase in total population or an aging population. Cancer death rates correct for changes in population&#xA0;<em>size</em>, age-standardized death rates correct for population <em>size and age structure</em>.&#xA0;Age-standardization therefore gives a more indicative measure of the prevalence and incidence of underlying cancer risk factors between countries and with time without the influence of demographic and population structure changes.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div></section>
