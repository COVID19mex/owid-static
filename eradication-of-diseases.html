These disease-causing microorganisms include bacteria, viruses, unicellular parasites, or larger parasites such as worms. We included them for all diseases discussed here in our summary table at the beginning of this entry. To eradicate a disease its pathogen needs to be eradicated. This means that diseases caused by one or a small number of pathogens are easier to eradicate than the ones caused by a larger number of pathogens. Examples make this clear:</p><ul>
<li>Smallpox, for instance, is caused by only two types&#xA0;of viruses that were eradicated in 1977 using a vaccine.</li>
<li>Lung infections, on the other hand, are an example of a disease named after their shared symptom: infection of the lung. But these symptoms can be caused by a large number of viruses and bacteria. This makes the disease &#x201C;lung infection&#x201D; non-eradicable.&#xA0;Wound infections are an even more extreme example as they can be caused by many bacteria that would not be harmful to a healthy human with intact skin.</li>
</ul><p>In other words, disease-causing organisms can be eradicated but not necessarily symptoms.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-disease-has-only-a-single-host"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-disease-has-only-a-single-host"></a>The disease has only a single host</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Diseases that only infect one species are easier to eradicate than diseases that infect many species, i.e. that have &#x201C;alternative hosts&#x201D;. Smallpox, for instance, was caused by a virus that only survived in and spread among humans.</p><p>Other diseases that have only humans as a host are:</p><ul>
<li>polio,</li>
<li>Guinea worm disease (dracunculiasis),</li>
<li>measles,</li>
<li>mumps,</li>
<li>pertussis (whooping cough), and</li>
<li>diphtheria.</li>
</ul><p>Many diseases unfortunately either rely on several hosts (vector-transmitted) or can even have several hosts as alternative reservoirs:</p><p>Malaria, lymphatic filariasis, and river blindness are examples of&#xA0;<strong>vector transmitted</strong>&#xA0;diseases. This means that the pathogen&#xA0;<em>requires several&#xA0;hosts</em> in its life cycle. The malaria parasite, for instance, needs both humans and certain types of mosquitos to survive.&#xA0;In a hypothetical scenario of all humans being cleared of malaria at the same time, mosquitoes could still carry the disease and re-infect humans. However, if all humans could somehow be protected from infections for a few months at the same time, the malaria parasite would eventually die out as all malaria-carrying mosquitos naturally have a short life span. If the malaria parasite was therefore not able to live on in humans before the malaria-carrying mosquitoes die a natural death, the parasite would be eradicated.</p><p>The influenza virus (which causes influenza or &#x201C;the flu&#x201D;), is an example of a pathogen <strong>with several alternative hosts</strong>. The influenza virus can infect humans, birds, pigs and other animals. It&#xA0;could survive in these animals even if all humans were somehow made immune. This means that even if a vaccine against all strains of the influenza virus existed,&#xA0;one would still have to immunize all humans, pigs and even wild birds to eradicate influenza.</p><p>Other examples of diseases with alternative hosts are</p><ul>
<li>rinderpest (infected cattle, buffalo, zebras, water buffaloes,&#xA0;African buffaloes, elephants, kudu, wildebeest,&#xA0;various antelopes, bushpigs, warthogs, giraffes,&#xA0;sheep, and goats);</li>
<li>hepatitis A (which infects humans and other vertebrates);</li>

<li>rabies (infects all warm-blooded vertebrae including all mammals); and</li>
<li>Japanese encephalitis (a so-called <em>dead-end disease</em>&#xA0;in humans, sheep, and cattle, which means that it is fatal and cannot spread, and is only transmitted among pigs).</li>
</ul><p>While it makes eradication easier when there is only one host, we know it is not a requirement: Rinderpest was successfully eradicated in 2011 and it was a disease with alternative hosts that affected cattle, sheep and goats but also antelopes, buffaloes, deers, giraffs, wildebeests and warthogs. However, most cases occurred in domesticated animals so that eradication was achieved by vaccinating all domestic species in parallel.</p><p>Diseases that are vector transmitted will be easier to eradicate than those with alternative hosts, because one has to eradicate the pathogen from only one species for a sufficiently long time.</p><p>The fact that the pathogen is reliant on several hosts makes vector transmitted diseases easier to eradicate than diseases with several alternative hosts but harder to eradicate than diseases with just one host. In reality, more factors play a role in determining whether a disease is eradicable or not. Malaria, for instance, is a vector-transmitted disease but it is not currently eradicable because no good measures exist against it (the second point in the necessary factors for eradication in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases#two-necessary-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">section II.1</a>).</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-disease-is-visible-and-good-diagnostics-exist"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-disease-is-visible-and-good-diagnostics-exist"></a>The disease is visible and good diagnostics exist</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Good monitoring of outbreaks is essential for eradicating a disease as it allows us to contain an outbreak and prevent the spread of the disease.</p><p>If the disease has visible symptoms in the majority of infections or when a good diagnostic method exists, monitoring is easier.

If symptoms only show in a minority of infections (e.g. polio) or if a diagnosis is difficult the disease can more easily spread unnoticed.</p><p>Another aspect that makes monitoring harder is if a disease is stigmatized.

In 1988, the <em>Global Polio Eradication Initiative</em> was set-up which has provided large-scale and, importantly, continued support for the eradication of polio. The number of paralytic polio cases has been greatly reduced such that in 2018 it is considered endemic in only three countries: Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria.</p><p>But polio also illustrates that positive developments might reverse. Nigeria&#x2019;s case numbers, for instance, surged from 202 in 2002 to 1143 in 2006 because of suspicions that immunization campaigns were a cover for Muslim sterilization by the US government which lead to an 11-month <a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a>boycott. The example of polio hence illustrates the importance of both international as well as local community support for eradication.</p><p> However, only Chad and Ethiopia recorded a positive number of Guinea worm cases in 2017.</p><p>The line chart illustrates the dramatic decline in the number of reported Guinea worm cases from two different data sources. From more than 892,000 reported cases in 1989, the number of reported Guinea worm infections dropped to only 25 infections worldwide in 2017 &#x2013; 13 in Chad and 12 in Ethiopia.</p><p>For the early period especially the number of reported cases is much lower than the true number of cases. Greenaway (2004) reports an estimate of 3.5 million cases for the year 1986.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-number-of-reported-cases-of-guinea-worm-disease" class="grapherPreview">

<li>Removing a disease from the list of existing diseases makes doctor&#x2019;s lives easier and patient&#x2019;s lives better by <strong>reducing the chance of mis-diagnoses</strong>.</li>
<li>No medication is needed to treat an eradicated disease. This <strong>slows the emergence of resistance</strong>. Take for example the (hypothetical) eradication of a bacterial disease. No more antibiotics will be used to treat cases (and suspected cases) of this disease. The reduced usage of antibiotics will slow the spread of resistance to antibiotics.<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a></li>
</ol><li>A disease that is eradicated can also <strong>no longer</strong> mutate or re-combine with other pathogens to <strong>form novel diseases</strong>.</li><li>The final benefit is&#xA0;<strong>saving cost in the long term</strong>. In several ways eradicating a disease reduces expenditure in the future:<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a></li><ul>
<li>The direct effect is that the eradication reduces the costs of prevention and treatment.</li>
<li>The indirect effect is that it decreases spending on diagnosing the disease and research into the disease.</li>
<li>Lastly, there is also the effect of having a more healthy population that as a consequence is more productive.</li>
</ul><p>Therefore eradication has economic benefits <em>in the long term</em> as more money is saved than the eradication campaign costs. This possibility is illustrated in the schematic comparison.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Eradicating vs controlling a disease: schematic comparison of the costs</h6><div class="wp-block-image">

While Salk&#x2019;s vaccine required injection with a needle, Sabin&#x2019;s vaccine is oral and can be swallowed. The latter feature made its distribution throughout the developing world possible, as fewer trained healthcare staff were required for its administration.</p><p>The chart here highlights the global decline of the&#xA0;<em>estimated</em> number of paralytic polio cases&#xA0;from 1980 onwards. In the peak year 1981, the number of paralytic polio cases are estimated to have exceeded 450,000 but were reduced to 43 cases in 2016 &#x2013; a more than 100,000-fold reduction of paralytic polio cases.&#xA0;As of 2019, wild polio virus is endemic in only three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In 2018, 9 countries have reported samples (human or environmental) positive for vaccine-derived poliovirus.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-estimated-paralytic-polio-cases-by-world-region" class="grapherPreview">

The bacterium infects humans and non-human primates. The name framboesia is derived from lesions that resemble raspberries (French: framboise).<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a></p><p>Within 90 days of being infected, patients develop symptoms in the form of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaws" target="_blank">lesions</a> which completely disappear again within six months. A second round of lesions erupt months to years later, also healing off again within six months but likely leaving behind scars. In approximately 10% of <em>untreated</em> cases, a third round of lesions can occur and result in complications such as destruction of skin, bones and cartilage. The Oxford Textbook of Medicine describes yaws as &#x201C;rarely fatal&#x201D;.<a id="ref-20" class="ref" href="#note-20"><sup>20</sup></a></p><p>Yaws is spread by&#xA0;skin-to-skin&#xA0;contact and rarely via objects, by bacteria entering through broken skin.

It is back on the WHO&#x2019;s list of diseases to be eradicated by 2020. This is believed feasible because effective antibiotics exist against yaws. The required mass treatments are relatively easy and cheap to administer.

Even today, only eight countries report yaws cases to the WHO.</p><p>The disease-causing pathogen of yaws was identified in 1905 but it was not until the establishment of the World Health Organisation in the aftermath of World War II that antibiotics were tested as a treatment option.<a id="ref-25" class="ref" href="#note-25"><sup>25</sup></a></p><p> Anecdotal evidence suggests that the disease burden prior to the WHO efforts was extremely high: In what today constitutes Ghana in 1936, 62.7% of all infectious diseases treated in government health facilities were yaws cases (for comparison, malaria only accounted for 20.3%).<a id="ref-26" class="ref" href="#note-26"><sup>26</sup></a> </p><p>It has been estimated that in 1955, there were 50 million yaws cases worldwide.<a id="ref-27" class="ref" href="#note-27"><sup>27</sup></a> Therefore, after a few pilot projects that tested the efficacy of the antibiotic penicillin, the WHO together with UNICEF launched mass treatment campaigns in 46 countries in 1952. By 1964, after screening approximately 300 million people and administering approximately 50 million penicillin doses to patients and their close contacts, yaws cases were said to be reduced by 95% to just 2.5 million cases. In light of such a successful reduction in yaws&#x2019;s disease burden, internationally coordinated mass campaigns were discontinued and countries&#x2019; primary health care systems were tasked with the elimination of the last 5% of cases. Global interest faded, developing countries&#x2019; healthcare systems already had too much on their plate and since no records were kept anymore, nobody knew how yaws numbers were developing.</p><p>It was only with a WHO review of its Neglected Tropical Diseases in 2012 that yaws regained international attention. The WHO even declared it its goal of eradicating yaws by 2020.<br>These renewed eradication efforts make use of a different antibiotic called azithromycin (described in the previous section) that can be administered orally. A new strategy is to give azithromycin to everyone living in a yaws-prone community, regardless of whether they suffer from yaws or not.<a id="ref-28" class="ref" href="#note-28"><sup>28</sup></a></p><p>To achieve the eradication of yaws, better monitoring in endemic countries as well as determining the endemicity status of all remaining countries will be necessary. For instance, it is unclear whether the disease is still in circulation in the Americas today.<a id="ref-29" class="ref" href="#note-29"><sup>29</sup></a></p><p> The world map visualizes the only data available &#x2013; a country&#x2019;s status of endemicity in 2016 and the number of cases for a few countries that reported yaws infections to the WHO. Fourteen countries are known to be endemic, even though for many more countries (all those shown in yellow) it is unknown whether yaws is still in circulation. Thanks to determined mass treatment and monitoring programs, India and Ecuador successfully eliminated yaws and are certified yaws-free by the WHO. They are coloured green in the map. Endemic countries are depicted in red or orange in the map, depending on whether the country reported the number of yaws cases to the WHO in 2016 or not, respectively. When hovering over the countries shown in red the number of cases will appear.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/yaws-status-and-case-numbers" class="grapherPreview">

<p>This is unfortunately the case for HIV and Tuberculosis.<br></p>
<p>There are five countries that managed to eliminate malaria between 1987 and 2007 (Armenia, Maldives, Morocco, Turkmenistan and the United Arab Emirates). However, neighboring countries of these still have malaria. While this is great news, malaria is not yet eradicable. Pathogens do not respect boarders, therefore the time malaria will be considered eradicable will be once a whole geographic region has eliminated the disease.<br></p>
