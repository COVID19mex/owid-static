</div><p>The ultimate goal in the fight against infectious diseases is their eradication. This goal has already been achieved for two diseases.&#xA0;Smallpox,&#xA0;a once very deadly human disease, and rinderpest, a disease that affected animals.</p><p>Diseases that could be eradicated next include polio, Guinea worm, yaws, Carrion&#x2019;s disease, hookworm, lymphatic filariasis, measles, ovine rinderpest, pork tape worm, river blindness, rubella, syphilis.</p><p>In this entry we do not cover all potentially eradicable diseases, but focus on the most promising ones:</p><ul>
<li><em><strong>Smallpox</strong></em> and <em><strong>rinderpest</strong></em>, the two diseases already eradicated [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases#successfully-eradicated-diseases">jump to section</a>]</li>
<li><em><strong>Polio</strong></em>, <em><strong>Guinea worm</strong></em>, and <em><strong>yaws</strong></em>, the three diseases that will hopefully be eradicated next [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases#eradication-of-other-diseases">jump to section</a>]</li>
</ul><p>We also discuss some theoretical background of eradication.</p><ul>
<li>Which two criteria need to be fulfilled to make a disease eradicable? [<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases#two-necessary-conditions">jump to section</a>]</li>

<li><em>Elimination</em>&#xA0;of a disease refers to the deliberate effort that leads to the reduction to zero of the incidence of infection caused by a specific agent in a defined geographic area. A disease can be eliminated from a specific region without being eradicated globally.

Diseases only became eradicable after scientific discoveries gave us the tools to fight them.</p><p>However two conditions are absolutely necessary for a disease to be eradicable and there are several characteristics of diseases which make it more likely for a disease to be eradicable.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="two-necessary-conditions"><a class="deep-link" href="#two-necessary-conditions"></a>Two necessary conditions</h3><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p><strong>1. It is an infectious disease</strong><br>For a disease to be eradicable it needs to be a disease you can &#x201C;catch&#x201D;, for example from other humans or animals, i.e. it has to be infectious. Non-infectious diseases, such as heart disease or cancer,&#xA0;cannot be eradicated.</p><p><strong>2. Measures against the disease exist</strong><br>To eradicate a disease we need to know of measures to fight its spread. The summary table above illustrates the diversity of such means against diseases.</p><p>Whilst the characteristics of a disease are biologically-determined or fixed, the available measures against the disease can progress through our scientific understanding and technological developments. This is where human ingenuity makes the fight against a disease possible. We discuss the different types of measures against infectious diseases next.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="the-means-to-fight-the-spread-of-diseases"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-means-to-fight-the-spread-of-diseases"></a>The means to fight the spread of diseases</h3><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Essential for the eradication of diseases is the development of means to fight their spread &#x2013; the second essential factor in the list above. Over the last centuries we have developed several means to fight the spread of infection and some of these have the potential to eradicate a specific disease entirely.</p><p>The appropriate measure to fight the disease depends on the type of pathogen and the way of transmission.&#xA0;For instance, antibiotics only work against bacteria, whilst anti-retrovirals only work against retroviruses. The way the disease is transmitted matters as well: if diseases spread via drinking water, filtering can stop the disease; if spread via mosquitoes, bed nets can stop the disease, etc.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="different-means-stop-different-pathogens"><a class="deep-link" href="#different-means-stop-different-pathogens"></a>Different means stop different pathogens</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The type of pathogen causing the disease is the first characteristic of a disease that informs the choice of appropriate measures against the disease.</p><p>These measures can be grouped into three categories, which are summarised in the figure.</p><p>The appropriate measure depends on the specific disease. Both smallpox and rinderpest were eradicated using vaccines. However, vaccines have not been developed against every disease yet,&#xA0;so other methods like water decontamination, wound treatment and health education to block transmission can be used with great success as well, such as in the case of Guinea Worm (dracunculiasis).</p><p><strong>Different transmission routes of the disease require different strategies</strong></p><p>The list below &#x2013; based on Checchi (2009)<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a>&#x2013; describes the routes of transmission for all diseases discussed in this article (<strong>bold</strong>) and a number of other common infectious diseases.</p><p><em>Direct transmission routes (suitable for ring-vaccination)</em></p><ul>

</ul><p>For those diseases that spread through direct contact between people &#x2013; those listed under direct-transmission routes &#x2013; the <strong>ring-vaccination principle&#xA0;</strong>can be applied.

This principle was successfully applied for the eradication of smallpox.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Measures against the spread of disease<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image">

In 1966, the WHO launched the Intensified Smallpox Eradication Program.

Death rates during rinderpest outbreaks were remarkably high, up to 100% in particularly susceptible herds.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p>The virus spread via infected droplets, so by inhaling sick animals&#x2019; breath, secretions or excretions. Rinderpest was a so-called dead-end disease for wild herds as their low population density inhibited the disease&#x2019;s spread. Together with the development of a potent vaccine in 1960, the dead-end in wild herds played an important role in achieving the disease&#x2019;s eradication in 2011. It is the first and until today only animal disease ever to be eradicated.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a></p><p>While Rinderpest did not infect humans it severely affected them.

For example, it allowed for the growth of vegetation that favoured the spread of the tse-tse fly.

This illustrates that while having effective means against a disease was important for eradication, the proper implementation of second-best means significantly reduced the disease burden even before.</p><p>Before the development of a vaccine, quarantine, improved hygiene, slaughter and inoculation<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a> were common practices in containing rinderpest. The former two practices were effective thanks to rinderpest&#x2019;s transmission requiring close contact between infected and susceptible animals. Europe managed to achieve rinderpest elimination this way at the beginning of the 20th century, long before the introduction of the vaccine.<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a></p><p>Slaughter was another means to contain Rinderpest&#x2019;s spread. It was understandably less popular because all cattle had to be killed if one infected member was identified. Nevertheless, European&#xA0;Russia successfully eliminated rinderpest this way in 1908.</p><p>Inoculating cows with inactivated virus samples from infected animals was an idea inspired by the variolation practice against smallpox in humans.&#xA0;Thailand, the Philippines and Iran, for example, managed to eliminate rinderpest before the Second World War using inactivated virus samples from cows.<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a></p><p>In 1960, finally, English veterinary scientist Walter Plowright developed an inactivated vaccine &#x2013; the&#xA0;<em>tissue culture rinderpest vaccine</em>, or TCRV &#x2013; that induced lifelong immunity without major side effects or the risk of further transmission and could be produced at a low cost.&#xA0;His success was based on figuring out how to grow rinderpest virus in a laboratory outside of living organisms, using a method called tissue culture.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a> In 1961, Albert Sabin used the same method to develop an oral polio vaccine.<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a></p><p> Plowright was awarded with the World Food Prize in 1999 for making rinderpest&#x2019;s <em>&#x201C;eradication, for the first time in human history, a practical objective&#x201D;</em>.<a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-history-of-rinderpest-eradication"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-history-of-rinderpest-eradication"></a>The history of rinderpest eradication</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Rinderpest was only ever endemic in Europe, Asia and Africa (with two isolated outbreaks in Brazil in 1920 and Australia in 1923).<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a></p><p>In 1994, the FAO launched the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme (GREP) with the goal of eradication by 2010.<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a></p><p> Thanks to the program&#x2019;s global surveillance and vaccination efforts (a ring vaccination strategy similar to that applied to smallpox was used)<a id="ref-20" class="ref" href="#note-20"><sup>20</sup></a>,&#xA0;the last known rinderpest outbreak occurred in Kenya in 2001 with the last case being recorded in Mauritania in 2003.

Recently, the original target to eradicate the Guinea worm by 2020 has been moved to 2030.

After this period&#xA0;a country can apply for certification by the International Certification Team of the WHO to verify that transmission has indeed been interrupted.&#xA0;Currently, Kenya and Sudan are at their pre-certification stage, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana and South Sudan are still endemic and Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo are not known to have Guinea worm but are also still to be certified.<a id="ref-34" class="ref" href="#note-34"><sup>34</sup></a></p><p> However, only Chad and Ethiopia recorded a positive number of Guinea worm cases in 2017.</p><p>The line chart illustrates the dramatic decline in the number of reported Guinea worm cases from two different data sources.

The bacterium infects humans and non-human primates. The name framboesia is derived from lesions that resemble raspberries (French: framboise).<a id="ref-36" class="ref" href="#note-36"><sup>36</sup></a></p><p>Within 90 days of being infected, patients develop symptoms in the form of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaws" target="_blank">lesions</a> which completely disappear again within six months. A second round of lesions erupt months to years later, also healing off again within six months but likely leaving behind scars. In approximately 10% of <em>untreated</em> cases, a third round of lesions can occur and result in complications such as destruction of skin, bones and cartilage. The Oxford Textbook of Medicine describes yaws as &#x201C;rarely fatal&#x201D;.<a id="ref-37" class="ref" href="#note-37"><sup>37</sup></a></p><p>Yaws is spread by&#xA0;skin-to-skin&#xA0;contact and rarely via objects, by bacteria entering through broken skin. An infection can spread from patients currently suffering from lesions, from people who carry the bacteria but at that moment do not have lesions, as well as from non-human primates.</p><p>Yaws was almost eradicated in the early 1960s already but re-emerged due to discontinued support from the WHO and lack of attention by governments&#x2019; healthcare systems. It is back on the WHO&#x2019;s list of diseases to be eradicated by 2020. This is believed feasible because effective antibiotics exist against yaws. The required mass treatments are relatively easy and cheap to administer. However, many countries do not monitor and report yaws cases to the WHO so that the global number of cases and thereby progress towards eradication remains largely unknown.<a id="ref-38" class="ref" href="#note-38"><sup>38</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="eradication-of-other-diseases-means-against-the-disease"><a class="deep-link" href="#eradication-of-other-diseases-means-against-the-disease"></a>Means against the disease</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The spread of the <em>Treponema pallidum</em> bacterium can be fought in two ways; improved hygiene and health education as well as antibiotic treatment.

After all, yaws ticks all the other boxes of our five features: it is caused by only one subspecies of bacteria, only infects humans and non-human primates, good and cheap means against and diagnostics for yaws exist and both India and Ecuador have successfully interrupted transmission. The reason why yaws has not been eradicated yet is &#x201C;simply&#x201D; that for a long time, yaws has been neglected; no eradication campaigns were run and no records of case numbers were kept. Even today, only eight countries report yaws cases to the WHO.</p><p>The disease-causing pathogen of yaws was identified in 1905 but it was not until the establishment of the World Health Organisation in the aftermath of World War II that antibiotics were tested as a treatment option.<a id="ref-42" class="ref" href="#note-42"><sup>42</sup></a></p><p> Anecdotal evidence suggests that the disease burden prior to the WHO efforts was extremely high: In what today constitutes Ghana in 1936, 62.7% of all infectious diseases treated in government health facilities were yaws cases (for comparison, malaria only accounted for 20.3%).<a id="ref-43" class="ref" href="#note-43"><sup>43</sup></a> </p><p>It has been estimated that in 1955, there were 50 million yaws cases worldwide.<a id="ref-44" class="ref" href="#note-44"><sup>44</sup></a> Therefore, after a few pilot projects that tested the efficacy of the antibiotic penicillin, the WHO together with UNICEF launched mass treatment campaigns in 46 countries in 1952. By 1964, after screening approximately 300 million people and administering approximately 50 million penicillin doses to patients and their close contacts, yaws cases were said to be reduced by 95% to just 2.5 million cases. In light of such a successful reduction in yaws&#x2019;s disease burden, internationally coordinated mass campaigns were discontinued and countries&#x2019; primary health care systems were tasked with the elimination of the last 5% of cases. Global interest faded, developing countries&#x2019; healthcare systems already had too much on their plate and since no records were kept anymore, nobody knew how yaws numbers were developing.</p><p>It was only with a WHO review of its Neglected Tropical Diseases in 2012 that yaws regained international attention. The WHO even declared it its goal of eradicating yaws by 2020.<br>These renewed eradication efforts make use of a different antibiotic called azithromycin (described in the previous section) that can be administered orally. A new strategy is to give azithromycin to everyone living in a yaws-prone community, regardless of whether they suffer from yaws or not.<a id="ref-45" class="ref" href="#note-45"><sup>45</sup></a></p><p>To achieve the eradication of yaws, better monitoring in endemic countries as well as determining the endemicity status of all remaining countries will be necessary. For instance, it is unclear whether the disease is still in circulation in the Americas today.<a id="ref-46" class="ref" href="#note-46"><sup>46</sup></a></p><p> The world map visualized the only data available &#x2013; a country&#x2019;s status of endemicity in 2016 and the number of cases for a few countries that reported yaws infections to the WHO. 14 countries are known to be endemic, even though for many more countries (all those shown in yellow) it is unknown whether yaws is still in circulation. Thanks to determined mass treatment and monitoring programs, India and Ecuador successfully eliminated yaws and are certified yaws-free by the WHO. They are coloured green in the map. Endemic countries are depicted in red or orange in the map, depending on whether the country reported the number of yaws cases to the WHO in 2016 or not, respectively. When hovering over the countries shown in red the number of cases will appear.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/yaws-status-and-case-numbers" class="grapherPreview">

<li>Removing a disease from the list of existing diseases makes doctor&#x2019;s lives easier and patient&#x2019;s lives better by <strong>reducing the chance of mis-diagnoses</strong>.</li>
<li>No medication is needed to treat an eradicated disease. This <strong>slows the emergence of resistance</strong>. Take for example the (hypothetical) eradication of a bacterial disease. No more antibiotics will be used to treat cases (and suspected cases) of this disease. The reduced usage of antibiotics will slow the spread of resistance to antibiotics.<a id="ref-47" class="ref" href="#note-47"><sup>47</sup></a></li>
</ol><li>A disease that is eradicated can also <strong>no longer</strong> mutate or re-combine with other pathogens to <strong>form novel diseases</strong>.</li><li>The final benefit is&#xA0;<strong>saving cost in the long term</strong>. In several ways eradicating a disease reduces expenditure in the future:<a id="ref-48" class="ref" href="#note-48"><sup>48</sup></a></li><ul>
<li>The direct effect is that the eradication reduces the costs of prevention and treatment.</li>
<li>The indirect effect is that it decreases spending on diagnosing the disease and research into the disease.</li>
<li>Lastly, there is also the effect of having a more healthy population that as a consequence is more productive.</li>
</ul><p>Therefore eradication has economic benefits <em>in the long term</em> as more money is saved than the eradication campaign costs.

<section><h2 id="five-features-which-make-eradication-easier"><a class="deep-link" href="#five-features-which-make-eradication-easier"></a>Five features which make eradication easier</h2><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>There are five key characteristics which are not absolutely necessary but make eradication easier.&#xA0;Dowdle (1999) writes:&#xA0;<em>&#x201C;In theory if the right tools were available, all infectious diseases would be eradicable. In reality there are distinct biological features of the organisms and technical factors of dealing with them that make their potential eradicability more or less likely.&#x201D;</em><a id="ref-50" class="ref" href="#note-50"><sup>50</sup></a></p><p><strong>1. The disease is caused by only a small number of pathogens</strong></p><p>Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens. These disease-causing microorganisms include bacteria, viruses, unicellular parasites, or larger parasites such as worms. We included them for all diseases discussed here in our summary table at the beginning of this entry. To eradicate a disease its pathogen needs to be eradicated. This means that diseases caused by one or a small number of pathogens are easier to eradicate than the ones caused by a larger number of pathogens. Examples make this clear:</p><ul>
<li>Smallpox, for instance, is caused by only two types&#xA0;of viruses that were eradicated in 1977 using a vaccine.</li>
<li>Lung infections, on the other hand, are an example of a disease named after their shared symptom: infection of the lung. But these symptoms can be caused by a large number of viruses and bacteria. This makes the disease &#x201C;lung infection&#x201D; non-eradicable.&#xA0;Wound infections are an even more extreme example as they can be caused by many bacteria that would not be harmful to a healthy human with intact skin.</li>
</ul><p>In other words, disease-causing organisms can be eradicated but not necessarily symptoms.</p><p><strong>2. The disease has only one host</strong></p><p>Diseases that only infect one species will be easier to eradicate than diseases that infect many species, i.e. that have &#x201C;alternative hosts&#x201D;. Smallpox, for instance, was caused by a virus that only survived in and spread among humans.</p><p>Other diseases that have only humans as a host are:</p><ul>
<li>polio,</li>
<li>Guinea worm disease (dracunculiasis),</li>
<li>measles,</li>
<li>mumps,</li>
<li>pertussis (whooping cough), and</li>
<li>diphtheria.</li>
</ul><p>Many diseases unfortunately either rely on several hosts (vector-transmitted) or can even have several hosts as alternative reservoirs:</p><p>Malaria, lymphatic filariasis, and river blindness are examples of&#xA0;<strong>vector transmitted</strong>&#xA0;diseases. This means that the pathogen&#xA0;<em>requires several&#xA0;hosts</em> in its life cycle. The malaria parasite, for instance, needs both humans and certain types of mosquitos to survive.&#xA0;In a hypothetical scenario of all humans being cleared of malaria at the same time, mosquitoes could still carry the disease and re-infect humans. However, if all humans could somehow be protected from infections for a few months at the same time, the malaria parasite would eventually die out as all malaria-carrying mosquitos naturally have a short life span. If the malaria parasite was therefore not able to live on in humans before the malaria-carrying mosquitoes die a natural death, the parasite would be eradicated.</p><p>The influenza virus (which causes influenza or &#x201C;the flu&#x201D;), is an example of a pathogen <strong>with several alternative hosts</strong>. The influenza virus can infect humans, birds, pigs and other animals. It&#xA0;could survive in these animals even if all humans were somehow made immune. This means that even if a vaccine against all strains of the influenza virus existed,&#xA0;one would still have to immunize all humans, pigs and even wild birds to eradicate influenza.</p><p>Other examples of diseases with alternative hosts are</p><ul>
<li>rinderpest (infected cattle, buffalo, zebras, water buffaloes,&#xA0;African buffaloes, elephants, kudu, wildebeest,&#xA0;various antelopes, bushpigs, warthogs, giraffes,&#xA0;sheep, and goats);</li>
<li>hepatitis A (which infects humans and other vertebrates);</li>
<li>ebola (infects bats as well as some bigger mammals);</li>
<li>rabies (infects all warm-blooded vertebrae including all mammals); and</li>
<li>Japanese encephalitis (a so-called <em>dead-end disease</em>&#xA0;in humans, sheep, and cattle, which means that it is fatal and cannot spread, and is only transmitted among pigs).</li>
</ul><p>While it makes eradication easier when there is only one host, we know it is not a requirement: Rinderpest was successfully eradicated in 2011 and it was a disease with alternative hosts that affected cattle, sheep and goats but also antelopes, buffaloes, deers, giraffs, wildebeests and warthogs. However, most cases occurred in domesticated animals so that eradication was achieved by vaccinating all domestic species in parallel.</p><p>Diseases that are vector transmitted will be easier to eradicate than those with alternative hosts, because one has to eradicate the pathogen from only one species for a sufficiently long time.</p><p>The fact that the pathogen is reliant on several hosts makes vector transmitted diseases easier to eradicate than diseases with several alternative hosts but harder to eradicate than diseases with just one host. In reality, more factors play a role in determining whether a disease is eradicable or not. Malaria, for instance, is a vector-transmitted disease but it is not currently eradicable because no good measures exist against it (the second point in the necessary factors for eradication in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases#two-necessary-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">section II.1</a>).</p><p><strong>3. The disease is visible and good diagnostics exist<br></strong><br>Good monitoring of outbreaks is essential for eradicating a disease as it allows us to contain an outbreak and prevent the spread of the disease.</p><p>If the disease has visible symptoms in the majority of infections or when a good diagnostic method exists, monitoring is easier. A smallpox infection, for instance, always led to visible pox and made monitoring simple.&#xA0;Pictures of infected people were shown and allowed health workers to find cases even in remote villages.<a id="ref-51" class="ref" href="#note-51"><sup>51</sup></a></p><p>Less visible diseases are harder to monitor. If symptoms only show in a minority of infections (e.g. polio) or if a diagnosis is difficult the disease can more easily spread unnoticed.</p><p>Another aspect that makes monitoring harder is if a disease is stigmatized. Sexually transmitted diseases for example might be hidden from the community intentionally.</p><p><strong>4. Elimination has proven possible<br></strong><br>It is promising if a disease has already been eliminated from certain geographical areas such as islands or even whole world regions.<a id="ref-52" class="ref" href="#note-52"><sup>52</sup></a></p><p> If, on the other hand, no country has ever eliminated a disease, it is likely that the current means against a disease are not effective enough yet to make eradication possible.<a id="ref-53" class="ref" href="#note-53"><sup>53</sup></a></p><p>Once a geographic region or indeed most countries worldwide have eliminated a disease, eradication becomes a feasible target.&#xA0;Currently there are three diseases that fall in this category: Polio, Guinea worm disease, and yaws. Because elimination of these diseases has been achieved these diseases are discussed in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases#eradication-of-other-diseases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">section IV: Eradication of other diseases</a> above.</p><p><strong>5. The perceived disease burden is high and financial, political and community support are available.</strong><br>The perceived burden of a disease, the estimated cost of eradication, and the political stability of affected countries are further factors that determine the eradicability of diseases.</p><p>Polio is a good example here as it illustrates the powerful impact of both a unified international effort and local political support. In 1988, the <em>Global Polio Eradication Initiative</em> was set-up which has provided large-scale and, importantly, continued support for the eradication of polio. The number of paralytic polio cases has been greatly reduced such that in 2018 it is considered endemic in only three countries: Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria.</p><p>But polio also illustrates that positive developments might reverse.

<p>This is unfortunately the case for HIV and Tuberculosis.<br></p>
<p>There are five countries that managed to eliminate malaria between 1987 and 2007 (Armenia, Maldives, Morocco, Turkmenistan and the United Arab Emirates). However, neighboring countries of these still have malaria. While this is great news, malaria is not yet eradicable. Pathogens do not respect boarders, therefore the time malaria will be considered eradicable will be once a whole geographic region has eliminated the disease.<br></p>
