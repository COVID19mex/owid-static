<h2 id="summary"><a class="deep-link" href="#summary"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>The ultimate goal in the fight against diseases is their eradication. In theory, many diseases could be eradicated, in practice, only a handful of diseases can meet the criteria required for it. In this entry we look at the progress the world has made in eradicating diseases, what makes a disease eradicable and  which diseases can we expect to eradicate in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>The world has eradicated two diseases:<br><strong>Smallpox</strong> was declared&#xA0;eradicated&#xA0;in 1980<br><strong>Rinderpest</strong> was declared eradicated in 2011</li>
<li>Key diseases that are considered eradicable today are: polio, Guinea worm disease, lymphatic filariasis, cysticercosis, measles, mumps and rubella. </li>
<li>Efforts to eradicate or eliminate additional diseases from parts of the world such as malaria, neonatal tetanus, rabies, river blindness, trachoma, and yaws are underway.</li>
<li>Eradicable diseases usually need to meet the following criteria: it&#x2019;s an infectious disease, humans are the major host of for the disease, effective vaccines or treatments are available for the disease, and there is political and financial support for the eradication efforts.</li>

<li><em>Eradication </em>of a disease refers to a deliberate effort that leads to the permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence of infection caused by a specific agent.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
</ul><p>Eradication means that intervention measures are no longer required, the agent, which previously caused the disease is no longer present. </p><ul>
<li><em>Elimination</em>&#xA0;of a disease refers to the deliberate effort that leads to the reduction to zero of the incidence of infection caused by a specific agent in a defined geographic area. A disease can be eliminated from a specific region without being eradicated globally. Actions to prevent the disease from transmitting or re-emerging are still required once a disease is eliminated.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>

Disease eradication is an ongoing process. New diseases can potentially be eradicated when scientific discoveries provide us with new tools to fight them.</p><p>In this entry we are primarily guided by the list of eradicable diseases provided by The International Task Force for Disease Eradication (ITFDE). ITFDE was formed in 1988 at the The Carter Center; it is supported by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and it advises bodies like The World Health Organisation on aspects of disease eradication.<a id="ref-3" class="ref" href="#note-3"><sup>3</sup></a> </p><p>The table here show the seven diseases that ITFDE has listed as eradicable diseases a decade ago.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a> These diseases are &#x2014; polio, Guinea worm disease, lymphatic filariasis, cysticercosis, measles, mumps and rubella.

In reality there are distinct biological features of the organisms and technical factors of dealing with them that make their potential eradicability more or less likely.&#x201D;</em><a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-disease-is-caused-by-only-a-small-number-of-pathogens"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-disease-is-caused-by-only-a-small-number-of-pathogens"></a>The disease is caused by only a small number of pathogens</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Infectious diseases are caused by pathogens. These disease-causing microorganisms include bacteria, viruses, unicellular parasites, or larger parasites such as worms. We included them for all diseases discussed here in our summary table at the beginning of this entry. To eradicate a disease its pathogen needs to be eradicated. This means that diseases caused by one or a small number of pathogens are easier to eradicate than the ones caused by a larger number of pathogens. Examples make this clear:</p><ul>
<li>Smallpox, for instance, is caused by only two types&#xA0;of viruses that were eradicated in 1977 using a vaccine.</li>
<li>Lung infections, on the other hand, are an example of a disease named after their shared symptom: infection of the lung. But these symptoms can be caused by a large number of viruses and bacteria. This makes the disease &#x201C;lung infection&#x201D; non-eradicable.&#xA0;Wound infections are an even more extreme example as they can be caused by many bacteria that would not be harmful to a healthy human with intact skin.</li>
</ul><p>In other words, disease-causing organisms can be eradicated but not necessarily symptoms.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-disease-has-only-a-single-host"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-disease-has-only-a-single-host"></a>The disease has only a single host</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Diseases that only infect one species are easier to eradicate than diseases that infect many species, i.e. that have &#x201C;alternative hosts&#x201D;. Smallpox, for instance, was caused by a virus that only survived in and spread among humans.</p><p>Other diseases that have only humans as a host are:</p><ul>
<li>polio,</li>
<li>Guinea worm disease (dracunculiasis),</li>
<li>measles,</li>
<li>mumps,</li>
<li>pertussis (whooping cough), and</li>
<li>diphtheria.</li>
</ul><p>Many diseases unfortunately either rely on several hosts (vector-transmitted) or can even have several hosts as alternative reservoirs:</p><p>Malaria, lymphatic filariasis, and river blindness are examples of&#xA0;<strong>vector transmitted</strong>&#xA0;diseases. This means that the pathogen&#xA0;<em>requires several&#xA0;hosts</em> in its life cycle. The malaria parasite, for instance, needs both humans and certain types of mosquitos to survive.&#xA0;In a hypothetical scenario of all humans being cleared of malaria at the same time, mosquitoes could still carry the disease and re-infect humans. However, if all humans could somehow be protected from infections for a few months at the same time, the malaria parasite would eventually die out as all malaria-carrying mosquitos naturally have a short life span. If the malaria parasite was therefore not able to live on in humans before the malaria-carrying mosquitoes die a natural death, the parasite would be eradicated.</p><p>The influenza virus (which causes influenza or &#x201C;the flu&#x201D;), is an example of a pathogen <strong>with several alternative hosts</strong>. The influenza virus can infect humans, birds, pigs and other animals. It&#xA0;could survive in these animals even if all humans were somehow made immune. This means that even if a vaccine against all strains of the influenza virus existed,&#xA0;one would still have to immunize all humans, pigs and even wild birds to eradicate influenza.</p><p>Other examples of diseases with alternative hosts are</p><ul>
<li>rinderpest (infected cattle, buffalo, zebras, water buffaloes,&#xA0;African buffaloes, elephants, kudu, wildebeest,&#xA0;various antelopes, bushpigs, warthogs, giraffes,&#xA0;sheep, and goats);</li>
<li>hepatitis A (which infects humans and other vertebrates);</li>
<li>ebola (infects bats as well as some bigger mammals);</li>
<li>rabies (infects all warm-blooded vertebrae including all mammals); and</li>
<li>Japanese encephalitis (a so-called <em>dead-end disease</em>&#xA0;in humans, sheep, and cattle, which means that it is fatal and cannot spread, and is only transmitted among pigs).</li>
</ul><p>While it makes eradication easier when there is only one host, we know it is not a requirement: Rinderpest was successfully eradicated in 2011 and it was a disease with alternative hosts that affected cattle, sheep and goats but also antelopes, buffaloes, deers, giraffs, wildebeests and warthogs. However, most cases occurred in domesticated animals so that eradication was achieved by vaccinating all domestic species in parallel.</p><p>Diseases that are vector transmitted will be easier to eradicate than those with alternative hosts, because one has to eradicate the pathogen from only one species for a sufficiently long time.</p><p>The fact that the pathogen is reliant on several hosts makes vector transmitted diseases easier to eradicate than diseases with several alternative hosts but harder to eradicate than diseases with just one host. In reality, more factors play a role in determining whether a disease is eradicable or not. Malaria, for instance, is a vector-transmitted disease but it is not currently eradicable because no good measures exist against it.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-disease-is-visible-and-good-diagnostics-exist"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-disease-is-visible-and-good-diagnostics-exist"></a>The disease is visible and good diagnostics exist</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Good monitoring of outbreaks is essential for eradicating a disease as it allows us to contain an outbreak and prevent the spread of the disease.</p><p>If the disease has visible symptoms in the majority of infections or when a good diagnostic method exists, monitoring is easier. A smallpox infection, for instance, always led to visible pox and made monitoring simple.&#xA0;Pictures of infected people were shown and allowed health workers to find cases even in remote villages.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></p><p>Less visible diseases are harder to monitor. If symptoms only show in a minority of infections (e.g. polio) or if a diagnosis is difficult the disease can more easily spread unnoticed.</p><p>Another aspect that makes monitoring harder is if a disease is stigmatized. Sexually transmitted diseases for example might be hidden from the community intentionally.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="elimination-has-proven-possible"><a class="deep-link" href="#elimination-has-proven-possible"></a>Elimination has proven possible</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>It is promising if a disease has already been eliminated from certain geographical areas such as islands or even whole world regions.<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p><p> If, on the other hand, no country has ever eliminated a disease, it is likely that the current means against a disease are not effective enough yet to make eradication possible.<a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p>Once a geographic region or indeed most countries worldwide have eliminated a disease, eradication becomes a feasible target.&#xA0;Currently there are three diseases that fall in this category: Polio, Guinea worm disease, and yaws.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="the-perceived-disease-burden-is-high-and-financial-political-and-community-support-are-available"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-perceived-disease-burden-is-high-and-financial-political-and-community-support-are-available"></a>The perceived disease burden is high and financial, political and community support are available</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>The perceived burden of a disease, the estimated cost of eradication, and the political stability of affected countries are further factors that determine the eradicability of diseases.</p><p>Polio is a good example here as it illustrates the powerful impact of both a unified international effort and local political support. In 1988, the <em>Global Polio Eradication Initiative</em> was set-up which has provided large-scale and, importantly, continued support for the eradication of polio. The number of paralytic polio cases has been greatly reduced such that in 2018 it is considered endemic in only three countries: Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria.</p><p>But polio also illustrates that positive developments might reverse. Nigeria&#x2019;s case numbers, for instance, surged from 202 in 2002 to 1143 in 2006 because of suspicions that immunization campaigns were a cover for Muslim sterilization by the US government which lead to an 11-month <a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a>boycott. The example of polio hence illustrates the importance of both international as well as local community support for eradication.</p><p> However, only Chad and Ethiopia recorded a positive number of Guinea worm cases in 2017.</p><p>The line chart illustrates the dramatic decline in the number of reported Guinea worm cases from two different data sources. From more than 892,000 reported cases in 1989, the number of reported Guinea worm infections dropped to only 25 infections worldwide in 2017 &#x2013; 13 in Chad and 12 in Ethiopia.</p><p>For the early period especially the number of reported cases is much lower than the true number of cases. Greenaway (2004) reports an estimate of 3.5 million cases for the year 1986.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-number-of-reported-cases-of-guinea-worm-disease" class="grapherPreview">

<li>Removing a disease from the list of existing diseases makes doctor&#x2019;s lives easier and patient&#x2019;s lives better by <strong>reducing the chance of mis-diagnoses</strong>.</li>
<li>No medication is needed to treat an eradicated disease. This <strong>slows the emergence of resistance</strong>. Take for example the (hypothetical) eradication of a bacterial disease. No more antibiotics will be used to treat cases (and suspected cases) of this disease. The reduced usage of antibiotics will slow the spread of resistance to antibiotics.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a></li>
</ol><li>A disease that is eradicated can also <strong>no longer</strong> mutate or re-combine with other pathogens to <strong>form novel diseases</strong>.</li><li>The final benefit is&#xA0;<strong>saving cost in the long term</strong>. In several ways eradicating a disease reduces expenditure in the future:<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a></li><ul>
<li>The direct effect is that the eradication reduces the costs of prevention and treatment.</li>
<li>The indirect effect is that it decreases spending on diagnosing the disease and research into the disease.</li>
<li>Lastly, there is also the effect of having a more healthy population that as a consequence is more productive.</li>
</ul><p>Therefore eradication has economic benefits <em>in the long term</em> as more money is saved than the eradication campaign costs. This possibility is illustrated in the schematic comparison.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Eradicating vs controlling a disease: schematic comparison of the costs</h6><div class="wp-block-image">

<p>This is unfortunately the case for HIV and Tuberculosis.<br></p>
<p>There are five countries that managed to eliminate malaria between 1987 and 2007 (Armenia, Maldives, Morocco, Turkmenistan and the United Arab Emirates). However, neighboring countries of these still have malaria. While this is great news, malaria is not yet eradicable. Pathogens do not respect boarders, therefore the time malaria will be considered eradicable will be once a whole geographic region has eliminated the disease.<br></p>

Polio for example spreads through the fecal-oral route, meaning that water sources contaminated with faeces from an infected person can expose hundreds of people to a disease rather than just those in direct contact with the infected person. This is why the ring-vaccination principle cannot be applied to for example polio.</p></li><li id="note-15"><p>More about antibiotic resistance in our blog posts on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ourworldindata.org/antibiotic-resistance-from-livestock" target="_blank">antibiotic resistance from livestock</a> and on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ourworldindata.org/vaccines-antibiotic-dependence" target="_blank">vaccines&#8217; antibiotic dependence</a>.</p></li><li id="note-16"><p>Bloom, D., Canning, D., &amp; Sevilla, J.
