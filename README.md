# wp-static

This is a static production bundle of all the pages and posts on https://ourworldindata.org/, generated from our Wordpress database and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). This includes all OWID content except for the embedded interactive charts, which are in [grapher-static](https://github.com/owid/grapher-static).

**Don't send pull requests to this repository.** It's only an export, so the changes would get overridden. Eventually it'd be great if we could accept pull requests, but we need to migrate away from using Wordpress internally first.
