In \nthe case of SCP, such instruments are designed and implemented to reduce the environmental \nimpacts of consumption and production patterns, with a view of generating economic and/or social \nbenefits.  \n\n \nMaking progress along the policy cycle refers to the development, adoption, implementation or evaluation \nof such policy instruments.   \n \nRationale: \nMainstreaming sustainable consumption and production in decision-making at all levels is a core function \nof the 10-Year Framework, which is expected to “support the integration of sustainable consumption and \nproduction into sustainable development policies, programmes and strategies, as appropriate, including, \nwhere  applicable,  into  poverty  reduction  strategies”  (Rio+20 Outcome  Document  –  A/CONF.216/5).  The \npurpose  of  this  indicator  is  to  help  assess  the  volume  and  geographical  repartition  of  governments \nprogressing on sustainable consumption and production. In addition, further information is being collected \non the types, focus and orientation of the policy instruments that are being developed and used, to monitor \n\n                                                           \n1 UNEP (2010). ABC of SCP: Clarifying Concepts on Sustainable Consumption and Production.   \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 14 February 2018 \n\ntheir  progression  over  time  as  well as  their  contribution  to  other  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  This \nshould  support  evaluation  of  how  much  /  how  fast  governments  progress  in  the  development  and \napplication of  policies  addressing  sustainable  consumption  and production,  whether  at  cross-cutting  or \nsectoral level. \n \nThe indicator is also considering both binding (laws and regulations) and non-binding policy instruments. \nThe first category is essential to the shift, as binding instruments provide the legal ground for sustainable \nconsumption and production, and can be used for enforcement or to provide incentives. The ability to \ndevelop, pass and implement legislation is an indication of jurisdictions’ engagement in the shift towards \nsustainable consumption and production. This indicator can also help monitor the evolution of the global \nlegislative landscape. The second category is also essential to ensure institutional engagement, \ncommitment and ownership. In some cases, non-binding policy instruments can lead to the creation of \nnew legal ones. The development and implementation of non-binding instruments across sectors also \nprovides information on engagement of partners and other stakeholders in sustainable consumption and \nproduction. \n \nConcepts: \nAs mentioned above, policy instruments are distinguished in legally binding policies and non-legally \nbinding ones. \n• \n\nLegally  binding:  a  legally  binding  policy  instrument  refers  to  a  system  of  rules,  procedures  and/or \nprinciples which are prescribed and enforced by a governing authority with the aim of requiring or \npreventing  specific  actions  or  providing  incentives that  lead  to  change  in  actions  or  preferences.  It \nincludes:  laws,  regulations,  standards,  by-laws,  codes,  etc.  They  can  relate  to  different  types  of \njurisdictions such as a ministry, state, municipality, or group of states.  \n\n•  Non-binding:  a  non-binding  policy  instrument  refers  to  a  coherent  set  of  decisions  associated  to  a \ncommon vision, objective and/or direction, and to a proposed course of action to achieve these. It \nincludes,  for  instance:  action  plans,  policies,  strategies,  programmes,  and  projects.  They  can  have \ndifferent scopes of application (international, national, local, etc.). \n\n•  At another level, different categories of policy instruments can be distinguished:   \no  Macro policies (e.g. national strategies/action plans, new institutions/entities) \no  Regulatory and legal instruments (e.g. laws, standards, enforcement measures) \no  Economic and fiscal instruments (taxes and tax incentives, grants, preferential loans, etc.)  \no  Voluntary  and  self-regulation  schemes  (e.g.  sectoral  partnerships,  codes  of  conduct,  CSR \n\ninitiatives) \n\n \n\n \n\nIt  is  important  to  note  that,  except  for  regulatory  /  legal  instruments  and  voluntary  /  self-regulation \nschemes, the options above are not mutually exclusive: for instance, an economic instrument can be legally \nbinding.  \n\n“Policy  cycle”:  this  political  science  concept  is  widely  used  to  analyse  and  inform  public  policy-making \nprocesses, but can be transposed to any recurrent pattern leading to the implementation of a policy or \npolicy instrument. The following approach with regards to the various stages of the policy cycle is adopted:  \n•  Policy development, including Agenda setting (e.g. the problem identified is high enough on the public \nagenda that action becomes likely) and Policy design (e.g. setting objectives, identifying costs-benefits \nof potential policy instruments and selecting);  \n\n•  Policy adopted or officially launched (e.g. adopting or authorizing the preferred policy options through \n\nthe legislative process and refined through the bureaucratic process);  \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 14 February 2018 \n\n•  Policy under implementation through specific actions (e.g. translating policy into concrete action and \n\npolicy instruments); results and impacts are being monitored; \n\n•  Policy and related action plan has reached its end date and has been evaluated. \n \nComments and limitations: \nWhereas the indicator quantifies and monitors countries’ progress along the policy cycle of binding and \nnon-binding policy instruments aimed at supporting Sustainable Consumption and Production; it does not \nprovide any qualitative information and whether policies were well-designed or if a proper background \nanalysis had been conducted, the quality of implementation, level of enforcement, and its effects. These \naspects will have to be looked at through narrative reports / qualitative analysis.  \n \nThe indicator encompasses policy instruments supporting the shift to SCP, including: policies which \nidentify SCP as a key priority, policies focused on SCP and sectoral policies with SCP objectives. It is \nacknowledged that sectoral policies are also being reported under other SDG indicators and in particular \n12.7.1 (# of countries implementing sustainable public procurement policies and action plans) and 12.b.1 \n(# of sustainable tourism strategies or policies and implemented action plans with agreed monitoring and \nevaluation tools). \n \nEstablishing baselines and targets can be time and resource intensive and depends on the willingness of \n10YFP National Focal Points to communicate necessary information.  \n \nMain aspects regarding precision, reliability, attribution and double counting are addressed above. If you \ncome across additional issues, please inform the 10YFP Secretariat. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \nTo be reported under this indicator, a government should have moved through one or more new stage(s) \nof the “Policy cycle” on one or more policy instrument(s) during the reporting period. \nThis  indicator  is  calculated  at  relevant  aggregation  levels  based  on  the  information  collected  from  the \nNational  Focal  Points  and  other  government  officials;  users  of  the  data  should  be  mindful  of  double \ncounting one same policy, when aggregating data across reporting years. \n \nDisaggregation: \n•  Country (using the official SDG country list provided by UNDESA). \n•  Ministry: Ministry of Environment / Sustainable Development / Natural Resources / Energy; Ministry \nof the Economy / Finance / Treasury; Ministry of Industry / Trade / Commerce / Labour; Ministry of \nPlanning  /  Development  /  Infrastructures;  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  /  Regional  /  International \nCooperation;  Ministry  of  Energy  /  Mineral  Development  /  Power;  Ministry  of  Science  /  Research  / \nTechnology / Innovation; Ministry of Agriculture / Livestock / Fisheries / Forestry / Food Security / Rural \nAffairs; Ministry of Tourism / Culture / Sports; Ministry of Transports / Roads / Works / Construction / \nBuilding; Ministry of Urban Development / Land Management / Housing; Ministry of Education / Higher \nEducation / Youth; Ministry of Poverty Alleviation / Social Welfare / Families / Women. \n\n•  Policy: macro-policy; policy instrument. \n•  Type  of  macro-policy:  macro-policy  specifically  focused  on  SCP;  macro-policy  with  SCP  as  a  key \n\npriority/objective; sectoral macro-policy with SCP objectives. \n\n\fLast updated: 14 February 2018 \n\n \n\n• \n\n• \n\nFocus  of  “macro-policy  with  SCP  as  a  key  priority/objective”:  sustainable  development;  green \neconomy/green growth; circular economy; development/poverty eradication; other (specified). \n\n•  Type of instrument: regulatory/legal; economic/financial; voluntary/self-regulatory \n•  Policy  cycle  stage:  Under  development  (initial  stage);  just  adopted;  under  implementation  through \n\nspecific actions; has reached its end date and has been evaluated.  \n\n•  Year of adoption: 2002 to 2022. \n• \n\nLegal status: binding/non-binding. \nSectors: Agriculture and fishery; Buildings and construction; Consumer goods; Culture and recreation; \nFinancial  sector;  Education;  Energy,  Food  &  Beverage;  Forestry;  Environmental  protection; \nEnvironmental  services;  Government  and  Civil  Society;  Housing;  Industrial  sector  (Including  SMEs); \nScientific  Research, Development  and  Innovation;  Tourism; Transport;  Waste (including  Chemicals); \nWater. \n\n• \n\n• \n\nfinancial \n\ninstitutions;  bilateral  organizations; \n\n•  Actors  involved:  national  ministries  or  other  specialized  national  agencies;  local  authorities;  civil \nsociety  organizations;  scientific  and  technical  organizations;  United  Nations/inter-governmental \norganizations; business sector.  \nSupport  received  from  non  –  national  partner:  United  Nations/inter-governmental  organizations; \nmultilateral \ninternational  non-governmental \norganizations. \nSupport  received  from  10YFP:  encouraged  the  development/implementation;  technical  support; \nfinancial support; capacity-building activities; experience and knowledge-sharing tools; no connection \nto 10YFP. \nSupport  received  from  10YFP  programmes:  sustainable  public  procurement;  sustainable  tourism; \nconsumer  information  for  SCP;  sustainable  food  systems;  sustainable  lifestyles  and  education; \nsustainable buildings and construction; none of the above. \nLink to other SDGs: SDG 1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11;13;14;15;16;17 \nImpact  measured:  Resource  efficiency;  environmental  impact;  human  well-being.

Thus “0.0” can represent either NA, or a \ngenuine 0.0, or (crucially) a combination of both, which is a common situation. This allows for values to be \neasily aggregated into further aggregations; however, it should be thus noted that due to imputing missing \nvalues as ‘0.0’, the aggregations may represent a lower value than actual situation.   \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\nSimilarly, missing values are imputed as zero in the regional and global aggregations.  \n\n \n\n \n\nNote: the disaggregation categories above are indicative and some can be left empty when reporting on \nmeasures for which such data elements are not available. \nData Sources \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 14 February 2018 \n\n \nDescription: \n•  Data is collected through an online survey based on this metadata sheet. \n•  The survey may include additional questions, such as those on inter-ministerial and/or multi-\n\nstakeholder coordination mechanism for SCP. \n\n•  The questions included in the survey can be revised as needed, in particular as data becomes \n\navailable through the survey and alignment may be required with related ongoing work under the \nSDGs. \n\n•  The 10YFP Global Survey on National SCP Policies and Initiatives, administered by the 10YFP \n\nSecretariat in 2015, and reported on by 10YFP National Focal Points, as well as the subsequent \nreport, may complement information and data collected.  \n\n \nCollection process: \n•  Data is provided by 10YFP National Focal Points. \n•  The survey is administered by the 10YFP Secretariat. \n•  A pilot data collection and reporting was undertaken to test the methodology and reporting tools in \n\n2017.
