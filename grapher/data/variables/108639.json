promote well-being for all at all ages \nTarget 3.6: By 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents \nIndicator 3.6.1: Death rate due to road traffic injuries \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \n \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nDeath rate due to road traffic injuries as defined as the number of road traffic fatal injury deaths per \n100,000 population. \n \nConcepts: \n \nNumerator: Number of deaths due to road traffic crashes \n \nAbsolute figure indicating the number of people who die as a result of a road traffic crash. \n \nDenominator: Population (number of people by country) \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nThere are no vital registration data for all countries to make comparison against the data received on the \nsurvey. We published only confidence intervals for countries that have poor completeness of vital \nregistration data. Also we cannot collect road traffic data every year using this methodology outlined in \nthe Global status report. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \nOur model is based on the quality of data we received. As a health organization, we rely primarily on the \nsubmission of vital registration data from countries’ Ministries of Health to WHO (through the official \nchannels). These data, on all causes of death, are then analysed by our colleagues in the Health \nInformation Systems department to decide on how good the data are, that is, determining if there is \ngood completeness and coverage of deaths for all causes.  \n \nWe classified the countries on 4 categories or groups namely, \n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\nGroup1: Countries with death registration data (good vital/ death registration data) \nGroup2: Countries with other sources of information on causes of death \nGroup3: Countries with population less than 150 000 \nGroup4: Countries without eligible death registration data. \n \nThe Health Information Systems department analyses the quality and the completeness of the data. For \nthe road safety model, if the country is considered by WHO to have good vital registration (VR) data this \nmeans that the country is in group1, then we don’t apply a regression model to come up with an estimate \n(we may, however, project forward if the vital registration data are dated). If the country is considered in \ngroup 4 then we apply a negative binomial regression where N is the total road traffic deaths , C is \nconstant term, Xi are a set of explanatory covariates, Pop is the population for the country-year, and ? is \nthe negative binomial error term. \n \nFor the countries from group 2, the regression method described above was used to project forward the \nmost recent year for which an estimate of total deaths were available. \n \nFinally, the countries from group 3 which have a population less than 150,000 and did not have eligible \ndeath registration data, regression estimates were not used. Only the reported death were directly \nwithout adjustment. \n \nMore details about this estimation process in Global Status Report on Road Safety 2015. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nWe disaggregated the data by types of road users, age, sex, income groups and WHO regions \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\n \nTreatment of missing data was carried out as follows: \n \n1) Identified missing values (or years) in vital registration (VR) data and looked for other sources in \nour case data from the questionnaire/survey (reported ) for these years. We then calculated the \nfactor VR/Reported for the latest 3 years where VR and Reported data were available and used this \nfactor to adjust Reported data to replace the missing value of VR data. \n \n2) In the case where there is missing data in VR and Reported data, the missing values were \nimputed with a negative binomial regression of rate for each country if the regression converged or \nwas significant. Otherwise we used the average rate of years with data. \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\n \nSame as the procedure described for 11.2 above \n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\nRegional aggregates: \n \nWe used the WHO's regional grouping and the average to calculate the rate for each region. This means \nsum of road traffic deaths for region (i) multiplied by 100,000 and divided by the population in region(i). \n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \nWHO's estimation of road traffic rates are, in many countries, different to the official estimates for the \nreasons described above that relate to our methodology. \n \nThere are also differences in the data used for population between the national data and the estimates \nproduced by the United Nations department of population. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nFor the road traffic deaths we have two sources of data. Data from Global Status Report on Road Safety \nsurvey and Vital registration or certificate deaths data that WHO receive every year from member states \n(ministries of health). \n \nFor the population, we used data from the United Nations / Department of Economic and Social Affairs/ \nPopulation division. \n \nCollection process: \n \nThe methodology involved collecting data from a number of different sectors and stakeholders in each \ncountry is as follows. National Data Coordinators (NDCs), who were nominated by their governments, \nwere trained in the project methodology. As representatives of their ministries, they were required to \nidentify up to eight other road safety experts within their country from different sectors (e.g. health, \npolice, transport, nongovernmental organizations and/or academia) and to facilitate a consensus meeting \nof these respondents. While each expert responded to the questionnaire based on their expertise, the \nconsensus meeting facilitated by NDCs allowed for discussion of all responses, and the group used this \ndiscussion to agree on one final set of information that best represented their country’s situation at the \ntime (up to 2014, using the most recent data available). This was then submitted to the World Health \nOrganization (WHO). More details are in the Global Status Report on Road Safety 2015. A guide to our \nquestionnaire describing age groups and other dimensions was provided to countries in order to \nstandardize data collected. \n \nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \n \nWe have data for 194 countries. \n \n\n\fLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\n \n\nTime series: \n \nFrom 2000 to 2013 \n \nCalendar \n\n \nData collection: \n \nThe next collection of data is planned for 2017, although the data collected on fatalities is likely to be \n2015 or 2016 (we will ask for the most recent country data available).  \n \nData release: \n \nThe new data for this indicator will be published in early 2019 \n  \nData providers \n\n \nThe road traffic deaths data were provided nationally by mainly three ministries, namely, ministry of \nhealth, ministry of interior and ministry of transport \n \nData compilers \n\n \nWHO is the organization responsible for compilation and reporting on this indicator at the global level \n \nReferences \n\n \nURL: \n
