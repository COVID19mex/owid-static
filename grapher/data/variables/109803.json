The data series for total proved coal reserves does not necessarily  meet the definitions, guidelines and practices used for determining proved reserves at company level, for instance as published by the US Securities and Exchange Commission,  nor does it necessarily represent BPâ€™s view of proved reserves by country.  Reserves-to-production (R/P) ratio - If the reserves remaining at the end of any year are divided by the production in that year, the result is the length of time that those remaining reserves would last if production were to continue at that rate. Reserves-to-production (R/P) ratios are calculated excluding other solid fuels in reserves and production. Shares of total and R/P ratios are calculated using million tonnes figures.","createdAt":"2019-11-20T13:20:01.000Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-20T13:20:01.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"","timespan":"","datasetId":4874,"sourceId":17605,"shortUnit":null,"display":{},"columnOrder":0,"originalMetadata":null,"datasetName":"BP Statistical Review of Global Energy","s_id":17605,"s_name":"BP Statistical Review of Global Energy (2019)","source":{"id":17605,"name":"BP Statistical Review of Global Energy (2019)","dataPublishedBy":"BP","dataPublisherSource":"","link":"http://www.bp.com/statisticalreview","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":""}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GBR"},"6":{"name":"Germany","code":"DEU"},"9":{"name":"Spain","code":"ESP"},"11":{"name":"Poland","code":"POL"},"12":{"name":"Russia","code":"RUS"},"13":{"name":"United States","code":"USA"},"14":{"name":"Japan","code":"JPN"},"23":{"name":"Australia","code":"AUS"},"37":{"name":"Brazil","code":"BRA"},"39":{"name":"Bulgaria","code":"BGR"},"44":{"name":"Canada","code":"CAN"},"62":{"name":"Uzbekistan","code":"UZB"},"67":{"name":"Ukraine","code":"UKR"},"70":{"name":"Turkey","code":"TUR"},"75":{"name":"Thailand","code":"THA"},"80":{"name":"Zimbabwe","code":"ZWE"},"81":{"name":"South Africa","code":"ZAF"},"84":{"name":"Vietnam","code":"VNM"},"88":{"name":"Serbia","code":"SRB"},"92":{"name":"Romania","code":"ROU"},"101":{"name":"Pakistan","code":"PAK"},"106":{"name":"New Zealand","code":"NZL"},"112":{"name":"Mongolia","code":"MNG"},"113":{"name":"Mexico","code":"MEX"},"127":{"name":"South Korea","code":"KOR"},"131":{"name":"Kazakhstan","code":"KAZ"},"136":{"name":"Indonesia","code":"IDN"},"137":{"name":"India","code":"IND"},"138":{"name":"Hungary","code":"HUN"},"149":{"name":"Greece","code":"GRC"},"162":{"name":"Czech Republic","code":"CZE"},"170":{"name":"Colombia","code":"COL"},"171":{"name":"China","code":"CHN"},"238":{"name":"Venezuela","code":"VEN"},"276":{"name":"Europe","code":null},"294":{"name":"North America","code":null},"355":{"name":"World","code":"OWID_WRL"},"25487":{"name":"Middle East","code":null},"25701":{"name":"Europe (other)","code":null},"33418":{"name":"Other Africa","code":null},"33419":{"name":"Other Asia & Pacific","code":null},"33723":{"name":"Middle East & Africa","code":null},"34608":{"name":"Asia Pacific","code":null},"35424":{"name":"South & Central America","code":null},"35428":{"name":"CIS","code":null},"35442":{"name":"Other CIS","code":null},"94023":{"name":"Other S. & Cent.
