promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster \ninnovation \nTarget 9.3: Increase the access of small-scale industrial and other enterprises, in particular in developing \ncountries, to financial services, including affordable credit, and their integration into value chains and \nmarkets \nIndicator 9.3.1: Proportion of small-scale industries in total industry value added \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) \n  \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nSmall-scale industrial enterprises, in the SDG framework also called “small-scale industries”, defined here \nfor the purpose of statistical data collection and compilation refer to statistical units, generally enterprises, \nengaged in production of goods and services for market below a designated size class. \n \nProportion  of  “small-scale  industries”  in  total  industry  value  added  represents  an  indicator  calculating  the \nshare  of  manufacturing  value  added  of  small-scale  manufacturing  enterprises  in  the  total  manufacturing \nvalue added. \n \nRationale: \n \nIndustrial enterprises are classified to small compared to large or medium for their distinct nature of \neconomic organization, production capability, scale of investment and other economic characteristics. \n“Small-scale industries” can be run with a small amount of capital, relatively unskilled labor and using local \nmaterials. Despite their small contribution to total industrial output, their role in job creation, especially in \ndeveloping countries is recognized to be significant where the scope of absorbing surplus labor force from \ntraditional sectors such as agriculture or fishery is very high. “Small-scale industries” are capable of meeting \ndomestic demand of basic consumer goods such as food, clothes, furniture, etc.  \n \nConcepts: \n \nInternational recommendations for industrial statistics 2008 (IRIS 2008) (United Nations, 2011) define an \nenterprise as the smallest legal unit that constitutes an organizational unit producing goods or services. The \nenterprise is the basic statistical unit at which all information relating to its production activities and \ntransactions, including financial and balance-sheet accounts, are maintained. It is also used for institutional \nsector classification in the 2008 System of National Accounts. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: March 2019 \n\nAn establishment is defined as an enterprise or part of an enterprise that is situated in a single location and \nin which only a single productive activity is carried out or in which the principal productive activity accounts \nfor most of the value added. An establishment can be defined ideally as an economic unit that engages, \nunder single ownership or control, that is, under a single legal entity, in one, or predominantly one, kind of \neconomic activity at a single physical location. Mines, factories and workshops are examples. This ideal \nconcept of an establishment is applicable to many of the situations encountered in industrial inquiries, \nparticularly in manufacturing. \n \nAlthough the definition of an establishment allows for the possibility that there may be one or more \nsecondary activities carried out in it, their magnitude should be small compared with that of the principal \nactivity. If a secondary activity within an establishment is as important, or nearly as important, as the \nprincipal activity, then the unit is more like a local unit. It should be subdivided so that the secondary activity \nis treated as taking place within an establishment separate from the establishment in which the principal \nactivity takes place. \n \nIn the case of most small-sized businesses, the enterprise and the establishment will be identical. Some \nenterprises are large and complex with different kinds of economic activities undertaken at different \nlocations. Such enterprises should be broken down into one or more establishments, provided that smaller \nand more homogeneous production units can be identified for which production data may be meaningfully \ncompiled.  \n \nAs introduced in IRIS 2008 (United Nations, 2011), an economic activity is understood as referring to a \nprocess, that is to say, to the combination of actions carried out by a certain entity that uses labor, capital, \ngoods and services to produce specific products (goods and services). In general, industrial statistics reflect \nthe characteristics and economic activities of units engaged in a class of industrial activities that are defined \nin terms of the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, Revision 4 (ISIC \nRev.4) (United Nations, 2008) or International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities, \nRevision 3.1 (ISIC Rev. 3) (United Nations, 2002). \n \nTotal numbers of persons employed is defined as the total number of persons who work in or for the \nstatistical unit, whether full-time or part-time, including: \n\n•  Working proprietors \n•  Active business partners \n•  Unpaid family workers \n•  Paid employees (for more details see United Nations, 2011). \n\n \nThe size of a statistical unit based on employment should be defined primarily in terms of the average \nnumber of persons employed in that unit during the reference period. If the average number of persons \nemployed is not available, the total number of persons employed in a single period may be used as the size \ncriterion. The size classification should consist of the following classes of the average number of persons \nemployed: 1-9, 10-19, 20-49, 50-249, 250 and more. This should be considered a minimum division of the \noverall range; more detailed classifications, where required, should be developed within this framework. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: March 2019 \n\nValue added cannot be directly observed from the accounting records of the units. It is derived as the \ndifference between gross output or census output and intermediate consumption or census input (United \nNations, 2011). The value added at basic prices is calculated as the difference between the gross output at \nbasic prices and the intermediate consumption at purchasers’ prices. The valuation of value added closely \ncorresponds to the valuation of gross output. If the output is valued at basic prices, then the valuation of \nvalue added is also at basic prices (the valuation of intermediate consumption is always at purchasers’ \nprices). \n \nAll above mentioned terms are introduced to be in line with IRIS 2008 (United Nations, 2011). \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nThe main limitation of existing national data is varying size classes by country indicating that data are \nobtained from different target populations. Data of one country are not comparable to another.  \n \nThe definition of size class in many countries is tied up with the legal and policy framework of the country. It \nhas implications on registration procedure, taxation and different waivers aimed to promote “small-scale \nindustries”. Therefore, countries may agree on a common size class for compilation purposes. In this context, \nUNIDO proposes that all countries compile the employment and value added data by a size class of “small-\nscale industries” as with less than 20 persons employed. From such data, an internationally comparable data \non the share of “small-scale industries” in total could be derived.  \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \nThe proportion of “small-scale industries” in total value added is an indicator calculated as a share of value \nadded for small-scale manufacturing enterprises in total manufacturing value added: \n \n\n𝑀𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑑 𝑜𝑓 \"𝑠𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑙 − 𝑠𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑒 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑠\"\n\n𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑢𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑑\n\n∗ 100 \n\n \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nData are collected primary from national sources, from official publications and official web-sites, and from \nOECD (Structural and Demographic Business Statistics) and EUROSTAT (Structural Business Statistics \ndatabase). \n  \nCollection process: \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: March 2019 \n\nCountries were contacted to provide information on data availability for monitoring small-scale industrial \nenterprises.
