However, lack of trust and confidence in the ability of the police or other authorities to provide \neffective redress, or objective and subjective difficulties in accessing them, can influence negatively the \nreporting behaviour of crime victims. As such, reporting rates provide a direct measure of the confidence \nof victims of crime in the ability of the police or other authorities to provide assistance and bring \nperpetrators to justice. Reporting rates provide also a measure of the ‘dark figure’ of crime, that is the \nproportion of crimes not reported to the police. Trends in reporting rates of violent crime can be used to \nmonitor public trust and confidence in competent authorities on the basis of actual behaviours and not \nperceptions. \n \nConcepts: \n \nCompetent authorities includes police, prosecutors or other authorities with competencies to investigate \nrelevant crimes, while ‘other officially recognized conflict resolution mechanisms´ may include a variety \nof institutions with a role in the informal justice or dispute resolution process (e.g. tribal or religious \nleaders, village elders, community leaders), provided their role is officially recognized by state authorities \n \nComments and limitations: \n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\nThe target relates to the multidimensional concepts of rule of law and access to justice and at least two \nindicators are required to cover the main elements of access to justice and efficiency of the justice \nsystem. The indicator 16.3.1 covers an important aspect of victim’s access to criminal justice, while it \ndoesn´t cover civil or administrative disputes. The indicator as formulated is a standard indicator widely \npublished when a victimization survey is undertaken, but further work is required to enhance a consistent \ninterpretation and application of this indicator. In particular, some important elements of this indicator \nneeds methodological guidance, such as the type of violent crime to include beyond physical assault; \ncounting rules regarding reporting rates (e.g. prevalence-based, incidence-based, based on last \nvictimization experience) and the type of competent authorities to consider. \n \nMethodological guidance on these issues is currently under development. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \nNumber of victims of violent crime in the previous 12 months who reported their victimization to \ncompetent authorities or other officially recognized conflict resolution mechanisms, divided by the \nnumber of all victims of violent crime in the previous 12 months (also called the ‘crime reporting rate’) \n \nBoth the number of victims of violent crime as well as the number of all victims of violent crime are \nmeasured through sample surveys of the general population, most often dedicated crime victimization \nsurveys. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nRecommended disaggregations for this indicator are: \n- sex \n- type of crime \n- ethnicity \n- migration background \n- citizenship \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\n \nMissing values are left blank \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\n \nMissing values are left blank.
