March 2019 \n \n\n \nGoal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages \nTarget 3.b: Support the research and development of vaccines and medicines for the communicable and \nnon‑communicable diseases that primarily affect developing countries, provide access to affordable \nessential medicines and vaccines, in accordance with the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and \nPublic Health, which affirms the right of developing countries to use to the full the provisions in the \nAgreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights regarding flexibilities to protect \npublic health, and, in particular, provide access to medicines for all \nIndicator 3.b.1: Proportion of the target population covered by all vaccines included in their national \nprogramme \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \nWorld Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) \n\nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \nCoverage of DTP containing vaccine (3rd dose): Percentage of surviving infants who received the 3 doses \nof diphtheria and tetanus toxoid with pertussis containing vaccine in a given year. \n \nCoverage of Measles containing vaccine (2nd dose): Percentage of children who received two dose of \nmeasles containing vaccine according to nationally recommended schedule through routine \nimmunization services in a given year. \n \nCoverage of Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (last dose in the schedule): Percentage of surviving infants \nwho received the nationally recommended doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in a given year.  \n \nCoverage of HPV vaccine (last dose in the schedule): Percentage of 15 years old girls received the \nrecommended doses of HPV vaccine. \n \nRationale: \nThis indicator aims to measure access to vaccines, including the newly available or underutilized vaccines, \nat the national level. In the past decades all countries added numerous new and underutilised vaccines in \ntheir national immunization schedule and there are several vaccines under final stage of development to \nbe introduced by 2030. For monitoring diseases control and impact of vaccines it is important to measure \ncoverage from each vaccine in national immunization schedule and the system is already in place for all \nnational programmes, however direct measurement for proportion of population covered with all \nvaccines in the programme is only feasible if the country has a well-functioning national nominal \nimmunization registry, usually an electronic one that will allow this coverage to be easily estimated. \nWhile countries will develop and strengthen immunization registries it is a need for an alternative \nmeasurement.  \n \nConcepts: \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: March 2019 \n \n\n \nIn accordance with its mandate to provide guidance to Member States on health policy matters, WHO \nprovides global vaccine and immunization recommendations for diseases that have an international \npublic health impact. National programmes adapt the recommendations and develop national \nimmunization schedules, based on local disease epidemiology and national health priorities. National \nimmunization schedules and number of recommended vaccines vary between countries, with only DTP \npolio and measles containing vaccines being used in all countries.  \n \nThe target population for given vaccine is defined based on recommended age for administration. The \nprimary vaccination series of most vaccines are administered in the first two years of life. \n \nCoverage of DTP containing vaccine measure the overall system strength to deliver infant vaccination \nCoverage of Measles containing vaccine ability to deliver vaccines beyond first year of life through \nroutine immunization services. \nCoverage of Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine: adaptation of new vaccines for children \nCoverage of HPV vaccine: life cycle vaccination  \n \n \nComments and limitations: \nThe rational to select a set of vaccines reflects the ability of immunization programmes to deliver \nvaccines over the life cycle and to adapt new vaccines. Coverage for other WHO recommended vaccines \nare also available and can be provided. \n \nGiven that HPV vaccine is relatively new and vaccination schedule varies from countries to country \ncoverage estimate will be made for girls vaccinated by ag 15 and at the moment data is limited to very \nfew countries therefore reporting will start later. \n \nMethodology \n\nComputation Method: \n \nWHO and UNICEF jointly developed a methodology to estimate national immunization coverage form \nselected vaccines in 2000. The methodology has been refined and reviewed by expert committees over \ntime. The methodology was published and reference is available under the reference section. Estimates \ntime series for WHO recommended vaccines produced and published annually since 2001. \nThe methodology uses data reported by national authorities from countries administrative systems as \nwell as data from immunization or multi indicator household surveys.  \n \nDisaggregation: \nGeographical location, i.e. regional and national and potentially subnational estimates \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n\n•  At country level \n\nThe first data point is the first reporting year after vaccine introduction. When country data are not \navailable interpolation is used between 2 data points and extrapolation from the latest available data \npoint.  \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: March 2019 \n \n\n \nAny needed imputation is done at country level. These country values can then be used to compute \nregional and global ones.  \n \nRegional aggregates: \nWeighted average of the country-level coverage rates where the weights are the country target \npopulation sizes based on World Population Prospects: 2017 revision from the UN Population Division. All \ncountries from the region are included.  \n \nSources of discrepancies: \nCountries often relay on administrative coverage data, while WHO and UNICEF review and assess data \nfrom different sources including administrative systems and surveys. Differences between country \nproduced and international estimates are mainly due to differences between coverage estimates from \nadministrative system and survey results. \n \nIn case the vaccine is not included in national immunization schedule the coverage from private sector \nwill not be reflected.  \n \nData Sources \n\nDescription: \nNational Health Information Systems or National Immunization systems  \nNational immunization registries \nHigh quality household surveys with immunization module (e.g. DHS, MICS, national in-country surveys)  \n \nCollection process: \nAnnual data collection through established mechanism.
