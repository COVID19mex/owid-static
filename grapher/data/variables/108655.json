healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages \nTarget 3.a: Strengthen the implementation of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on \nTobacco Control in all countries, as appropriate \nIndicator 3.a.1: Age-standardized prevalence of current tobacco use among persons aged 15 years \nand older \n \nInstitutional information \n\nOrganizations: \nWorld Health Organization;   \nSecretariat of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \nThe indicator is defined as the percentage of the population aged 15 years and over who currently use \nany tobacco product (smoked and/or smokeless tobacco) on a daily or non-daily basis. \n \nRationale: \nTobacco use is a major contributor to illness and death from non-communicable diseases (NCDs). There is \nno proven safe level of tobacco use or of second-hand smoke exposure.  All daily and non-daily users of \ntobacco are at risk of a variety of poor health outcomes across the life-course, including NCDs. Reducing \nthe prevalence of current tobacco use will make a large contribution to reducing premature mortality \nfrom NCDs (Target 3.4). Routine and regular monitoring of this indicator is necessary to enable accurate \nmonitoring and evaluation of the impact of implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on \nTobacco Control (WHO FCTC), or tobacco control policies in the countries that are not yet Parties to the \nWHO FCTC, over time. Tobacco use prevalence levels are an appropriate indicator of implementation of \nSDG Target 3.a “Strengthen the implementation of the World Health Organization Framework \nConvention on Tobacco Control in all countries, as appropriate”. \n \nConcepts: \nTobacco use means use of smoked and/or smokeless tobacco products.  “Current use” means use within \nthe previous 30 days at the time of the survey, whether daily or non-daily use. \n \nTobacco products means products entirely or partly made of the leaf tobacco as raw material intended \nfor human consumption through smoking, sucking, chewing or sniffing.   \n“Smoked tobacco products” include cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars, cheroots, bidis, pipes, shisha (water \npipes), roll-your-own tobacco, kretek and any other form of tobacco that is consumed by smoking. \n \n\"Smokeless tobacco product\" includes moist snuff, creamy snuff, dry snuff, plug, dissolvables, gul, loose \nleaf, red tooth powder, snus, chimo, gutkha, khaini, gudakhu, zarda, quiwam, dohra, tuibur, nasway, \nnaas, naswar, shammah, toombak, paan (betel quid with tobacco), iq’mik, mishri, tapkeer, tombol and \nany other tobacco product that consumed by sniffing, holding in the mouth or chewing. \n \n\n\fDate updated: 15 November 2017 \n\nPrevalence estimates have been “age-standardized” to make them comparable across all countries no \nmatter the demographic profile of the country. This is done by applying each country’s age-and-sex \nspecific prevalence rates to the WHO Standard Population.  The resulting rates are hypothetical numbers \nwhich are only meaningful when comparing rates obtained for one country \nwith those obtained for another country. \n \nComments and limitations: \nRaw data collected through nationally representative population-based surveys in the countries are used \nto calculate comparable estimates for this indicator.  Information from subnational surveys are not used.  \n \nWhile less than 1 in 5 countries are currently reporting on all types of tobacco use, three-quarters of \ncountries have robust data on tobacco smoking.  Until the majority of countries are reporting on all types \nof tobacco use (smoked and smokeless), this indicator will be populated with tobacco smoking rates.  In \nsome countries, all tobacco use and tobacco smoking may be equivalent, but for many countries, \nsmoking rates will be lower than tobacco use rates to some degree.   \n \nThe comparability, quality and frequency of household surveys affects the accuracy and quality of the \nestimates. Non-comparability of data can arise from the use of different survey instruments, sampling \nand analysis methods, and indicator definitions across Member States. Surveys may cover a variety of age \nranges (not always 15+) and be repeated at irregular intervals. Surveys may include a variety of different \ntobacco products, or sometimes only one product such as cigarettes, based on the country’s perception \nof which products are important to monitor. Unless both smoked and smokeless products are monitored \nsimultaneously, tobacco use prevalence will be underreported. Countries have begun to monitor use of \ne-cigarettes and other emerging products, which may confound countries’ definitions of tobacco use. The \ndefinition of current use may not always be restricted to the 30 days prior to the survey. In addition, \nsurveys ask people to self-report their tobacco use, which can lead to under-reporting of tobacco use.  \n \nThere is no standard protocol used across Member States to ask people about their tobacco use. WHO’s \nTobacco Questions for Surveys (TQS) have been adopted in many surveys, which helps improve \ncomparability of indicators across countries. \n \nMethodology \n\nComputation Method: \nA statistical model based on a Bayesian negative binomial meta-regression is used to model prevalence of \ncurrent tobacco smoking for each country, separately for men and women. A full description of the \nmethod is available as a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet, volume 385, No. 9972, p966–976 (2015).  \nOnce the age-and-sex-specific prevalence rates from national surveys were compiled into a dataset, the \nmodel was fit to calculate trend estimates from the year 2000 to 2030. The model has two main \ncomponents: (a) adjusting for missing indicators and age groups, and (b) generating an estimate of trends \nover time as well as the 95% credible interval around the estimate. Depending on the \ncompleteness/comprehensiveness of survey data from a particular country, the model at times makes \nuse of data from other countries to fill information gaps. To fill data gaps, information is “borrowed” from \ncountries in the same UN sub-region. The resulting trend lines are used to derive estimates for single \nyears, so that a number can be reported even if the country did not run a survey in that year.  In order to \nmake the results comparable between countries, the prevalence rates are age-standardized to the WHO \nStandard Population. \n\n\fDate updated: 15 November 2017 \n\n \nEstimates for countries with irregular surveys or many data gaps will have large uncertainty ranges, and \nsuch results should be interpreted with caution. \n \nDisaggregation: \nBy sex. \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\nFor countries with less than two surveys completed in different years since 1990, no estimate is \ncalculated, since no trend can be determined.  For countries with data from two or more surveys, \ndata gaps, if any, are filled as described in the Computation Method. \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\nCountries where no estimate can be calculated are included in regional and global averages by \nassuming their prevalence rates for men and women are equal to the average rates for men and \nwomen seen in the UN sub-region1 in which they are located.  Where fewer than 50% of a UN sub-\nregion’s population was surveyed, UN sub-regions are grouped with neighbouring sub-regions until \nat least 50% of the grouped population has contributed data to the region’s average rates. \n \n\nRegional aggregates: \nAverage prevalence rates for regions are calculated by population-weighting the age-specific prevalence \nrates in countries, then age-standardizing the age-specific average rates of the region. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \nWHO estimates differ from national estimates in that they are  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nage-standardised to improve international comparability and  \ncalculated using different methods. Infrequent surveys or unavailability of recent surveys \nlead to more reliance on modelling.  \n\nAs the data set for each country improves over time with addition of new surveys, recent estimates may \nseem inconsistent with earlier estimates. WHO estimates undergo country consultation prior to release. \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \n\n• \n\nInformation not available. \n\n \nQuality assurance \n\n• \n\nInformation not available \n\n \n \n\n                                                           \n1 For a listing of countries by UN region, please refer to pages ix to xiii of World Population Prospects: The 2015 \nRevision, published by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs in 2015 at \nhttps://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2015_Volume-I_Comprehensive-Tables.pdf (accessed \nMay 25, 2017). For the purposes of smoking analysis, the following adjustments were made: (i) Eastern Africa \nsub-region was divided into two regions: Eastern Africa Islands and Remainder of Eastern Africa; (ii) Armenia, \nAzerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and \nTurkmenistan were classified with Eastern Europe, (iii); Cyprus, Israel and Turkey were classified with Southern \nEurope, and (iv) Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia sub-regions were combined into one sub-region. \n\n\fDate updated: 15 November 2017 \n\nData Sources \n\nDescription: \nPrevalence rates by age-by-sex from national representative population surveys conducted since 1990: \n\n•  officially recognized by the national health authority; \n•  of randomly selected participants representative of the general population; and \n• \n\nreporting at least one indicator measuring current tobacco use, daily tobacco use, \ncurrent tobacco smoking, daily tobacco smoking, current cigarette smoking or daily \ncigarette smoking. \n\n \nOfficial survey reports are gathered from Member States by one or more of the following methods: \n\n• \n• \n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\nreporting system of the WHO FCTC; \nreview of surveys conducted under the aegis of the Global Tobacco Surveillance System; \nreview of other surveys conducted in collaboration with WHO such as STEPwise surveys \nand World Health Surveys; \nscanning of international surveillance databases such as those of the Demographic and \nHealth Survey (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) and the World Bank Living \nStandards Measurement Survey (LSMS); and \nidentification and review of country-specific surveys that are not part of international \nsurveillance systems. \n\nCollection process: \nReports either downloaded from websites or emailed by national counterparts. WHO shares and makes \npublic the methodologies for its estimates through the WHO global report on trends in tobacco smoking \n2000-2025 and the WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic. The WHO estimates undergo country \nconsultation prior to publication. \n \nData Availability \n\nDescription: \nThe indicator is available for all countries from 2000 to the current year, depending
