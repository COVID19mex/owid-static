implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, \nhalt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation \nglobally \nIndicator 15.2.1: Progress towards sustainable forest management  \n \nInstitutional information  \n\nOrganization(s):  \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)  \n \nConcepts and definitions  \n\nDefinition:  \n“Sustainable forest management” (SFM) is a central concept for Goal 15 and target 15.1 as well as for \ntarget 15.2. It has been formally defined, by the UN General Assembly, as follows:  \n \n[a] dynamic and evolving concept [that] aims to maintain and enhance the economic, social and \nenvironmental values of all types of forests, for the benefit of present and future generations” (Resolution \nA/RES/62/98)  \n \nThe indicator is composed of five sub-indicators that measure progress towards all dimensions of \nsustainable forest management. The environmental values of forests are covered by three sub-indicators \nfocused on the extension of forest area, biomass within the forest area and protection and maintenance \nof biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources. Social and economic values of \nforests are reconciled with environmental values through sustainable management plans. The sub-\nindicator provides further qualification to the management of forest areas, by assessing areas which are \nindependently verified for compliance with a set of national or international standards.  \n \nThe sub-indicators are:  \n1.  Forest area annual net change rate  \n2.  Above-ground biomass stock in forest  \n3.  Proportion of forest area located within legally established protect areas  \n4.  Proportion of forest area under a long term forest management plan  \n5.  Forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme  \n \nA dashboard is used to assess progress related to the five sub-indicators. The adoption of the dashboard \napproach aims at ensuring consideration of all dimensions of sustainable forest management and \nprovides for clear view of areas where progress has been achieved.  \n \n\nThe definition of SFM by the UN General Assembly contains several key aspects, notably that sustainable \nforest management is a concept which varies over time and between countries, whose circumstances – \necological, social and economic – vary widely, but that it should always address a wide range of forest \n\nRationale:  \n\n \n\n\fLast update: March 2019 \n\nvalues, including economic, social and environmental values, and take intergenerational equity into \naccount.  \n\nClearly a simple measure of forest area is insufficient to monitor sustainable forest management as a \nwhole. The significance of the five sub-indicators can be briefly explained as follows:  \n\n1.  Trends in forest area are crucial for monitoring SFM. The first sub-indicator focuses on both the \n\ndirection of change (whether there is a loss or gain in forest area) and how the change rate is \nchanging over time; the latter is important in order to capture progress among countries that are \nlosing forest area, but have managed to reduce the rate of annual forest area loss.  \n\n2.  Changes in the above-ground biomass stock in forest indicate the balance between gains in biomass \n\nstock due to forest growth and losses due to wood removals, natural losses, fire, wind, pests and \ndiseases. At country level and over a longer period, sustainable forest management would imply a \nstable or increasing biomass stock per hectare, while a long-term reduction of biomass stock per \nhectare would imply either unsustainable management of the forests and degradation or unexpected \nmajor losses due to fire, wind, pests or diseases.  \n\n3.  The change in forest area within legally protected areas is a proxy for trends in conservation of forest \n\nbiodiversity as well as cultural and spiritual values of forests and thus a clear indication of the \npolitical will to protect and conserve forests. This indicator is related to the CBD Aichi Target 11 \nwhich calls for each country to conserve at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas.  \n\n4.  The fourth sub-indicator looks at the forest area that is under a long term forest management plan. \nThe existence of a documented forest management plan is the basis for long term and sustainable \nmanagement of the forest resources for a variety of management objectives such as for wood and \nnon-wood forest products, protection of soil and water, biodiversity conservation, social and cultural \nuse, and a combination of two or several of these. An increasing area under forest management plan \nis therefore an indicator of progress towards sustainable forest management.  \n\n5.  The fifth sub-indicator is the forest area that is certified by an independently verified forest \n\nmanagement certification scheme. Such certification schemes apply standards that generally are \nhigher than those established by the countries’ own normative frameworks, and compliance is \nverified by an independent and accredited certifier. An increase in certified forest area therefore \nprovides an additional indication of progress towards sustainable forest management. It should \nhowever be noted that there are significant areas of sustainably managed forest which are not \ncertified, either because their owners have chosen not to seek certification (which is voluntary and \nmarket-based) or because no credible or affordable certification scheme is in place for that area.  \n\n \nConcepts:  \nSee Annex 1 with Terms and Definitions.  \n \nComments and limitations:  \nThe five sub-indicators chosen to illustrate progress towards sustainable forest management do not fully \ncover all aspects of sustainable forest management. In particular, social and economic aspects are \nsummarized under the sub-indicators on areas under sustainable forest management plans. Furthermore, \nas the trends are calculated using only those countries which have data complete time series, different \nsub-indicators may reflect different sets of countries.  \n \n\n \n\n\fWhile the dashboard illustrates the progress on the individual sub-indicators, there is no weighting of the \nrelative importance of the sub-indicators.  \n\nLast update: March 2019 \n\n \nMethodology  \n\nComputation Method:  \nNational data on forest area, biomass stock, forest area within protected areas, and forest area under \nmanagement plan are reported directly by countries to FAO for pre-established reference years. Based on \nthe country reported data, FAO then makes country-level estimates of the forest area net change rate \nusing the compound interest formula. The proportion of forest area within protected area and under \nmanagement plan is calculated using the reported areas and the official FAOSTAT land area for reference \nyear 2015. Data on forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme \nare reported to FAO by the head offices of respective forest certification scheme, who are jointly \nadjusting the figures to remove any double accounting.  \n\nNo dashboard traffic lights are made at country level.  \n\n \nDisaggregation:  \nNo further disaggregation of this indicator.  \n\n \nTreatment of missing values:  \n•  At country level  \n\nFor countries and territories where no information was provided to FAO for FRA 2015 (79 countries \nand territories representing 1.2 percent of the global forest area), a report was prepared by FAO \nusing existing information from previous assessments and literature search.  \n\n•  At regional and global levels  \n\nSee above.  \n\nRegional aggregates:  \nSee Annex 2 – Methodology. It should be noted that for those sub-indicators where there are gaps in the \ndata set, only the countries that reported a complete time series are included in the regional and global \naggregates. Annex 2 also shows how the dashboard traffic lights are applied at global and regional level.  \n\nSources of discrepancies:  \nThe national figures in the database are reported by the countries themselves following a standardized \nformat, definitions and reporting years, thus eliminating any discrepancies between global and national \nfigures. The reporting format ensures that countries provide the full reference for original data sources as \nwell as national definitions and terminology. Separate sections in the reporting format (country reports) \ndeal with the analysis of data (including any assumptions made and the methods used for estimates and \nprojections to the common reporting years); calibration of data to the official land area as held by FAO; \nand reclassification of data to the classes used in FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessments.  \n\nRegarding the data on forest area under an independently verified forest management certification \nscheme, these are usually not part of official national statistics, and are maintained by local offices of the \nrespective certification schemes. They in turn report their data to their head offices. As certified forest \narea is dynamic and can change monthly as some certificates expire and new certificates come. \n\n \n\n\fLast update: March 2019 \n\nTherefore, the data are requested to correspond to the end of June each year. However, the data are not \nalways reported by the local offices according to that date.  \n\n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:  \nData on sub-indicators 1 to 4 are provided to FAO by countries in the form of a country report following a \nstandard format, which includes the original data and reference sources and descriptions of how these \nhave been used to estimate the forest area for different points in time.  \n\nDetailed methodology and guidance on how to prepare the country reports and to convert national data \naccording to national categories and definitions to FAO’s global categories and definitions is found in the \ndocument “Guide for country reporting for FRA 2015”, http://www.fao.org/3/a-au190e.pdf.  \n\nQuality assurance  \nOnce received, the country reports undergo a rigorous review process to ensure correct use of definitions \nand methodology as well as internal consistency. A comparison is made with past assessments and other \nexisting data sources. Regular contacts between national correspondents and FAO staff by e-mail and \nregional/sub-regional review workshops form part of this review process.  \n\nAll country reports (including those prepared by FAO) are sent to the respective Head of Forestry for \nvalidation before finalization and publishing of data. The data are then aggregated at sub-regional, \nregional and global levels by the FRA team at FAO.  \n\nData Sources  \n\nSub-indicators 1 to 4 \n\nDescription:  \nData on the sub-indicators are collected periodically (until now every 5 years) by FAO’s Global Forest \nResources Assessment (FRA) programme. All data are provided to FAO by countries in the form of a \ncountry report following a standard format, which includes the original data and reference sources and \ndescriptions of how these have been used to estimate the forest area for different points in time.  \n\nCollection process:  \nOfficially nominated national correspondents and their teams prepare the country reports for the \nassessment. Some prepare more than one report as they also report on dependent territories. For the \nremaining countries and territories where no information is provided, a report is prepared by FAO using \nexisting information and a literature search.  \n\nIn order to obtain internationally comparable data, countries are requested to provide national \ncategories and definitions, and in case these are different than the FAO categories and definitions, \ncountries are requested to perform a reclassification of national data to correspond to the FAO \ncategories and definitions and to document this step in the country report. Countries are also requested \nto use interpolation or extrapolation of national data in order to provide estimates for the specific \nreporting years.  \n\nSub-indicator 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast update: March 2019 \n\nData on forest certification is submitted annually to FAO by the head offices of the respective forest \ncertification scheme. Data include the area certified by each scheme, as well as areas that are double-\ncertified by the two main schemes. That allows for estimating the total certified forest area, adjusted for \ndouble certified area.  \n\nCurrently, forest certification by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the \nEndorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) are included in the data submissions.

It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban \nland use.  \n\nForest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land uses. The trees should \nbe able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters.  \n\nIncludes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a canopy cover of at least \n10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-\ncutting as part of a forest management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within \n5 years. Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used. \n\nIncludes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature reserves and other \nprotected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest. \n\nIncludes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares and width of more \nthan 20 meters. \n\nIncludes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or are expected to reach, a \ncanopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least 5 meters. \n\nIncludes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this area is classified as land area or not. \n\nIncludes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations.  \n\nIncludes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover criteria are met. \n\n9.  Excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive \n\norchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover. Note: Some agroforestry systems such as \nthe “Taungya” system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as \nforest. \n\nAll living biomass above the soil including stem, stump, branches, bark, seeds, and foliage. \n\n1. \n\nIn cases where forest understorey is a relatively small component of the aboveground biomass carbon pool, it is \nacceptable to exclude it, provided this is done in a consistent manner throughout the inventory time series. \n\nABOVE-GROUND BIOMASS \n\nExplanatory note  \n\nPROTECTED AREAS \n\nAreas especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated \ncultural resources, and managed through legal or other effective means. \n\n                                                           \n1 Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015 – Terms and Definitions. http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap862e/ap862e00.pdf  \n\n1. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\n8. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fFOREST AREA WITHIN PROTECTED AREAS \n\nForest area within formally established protected areas independently of the purpose for which the protected areas \nwere established.  \n\nLast update: March 2019 \n\nExplanatory notes \n\n1. \n\nIncludes IUCN Categories I – IV \n\n2.

A forest area with management plan may refer to forest management unit level or aggregated forest management \n\nunit level (forest blocks, farms, enterprises, watersheds, municipalities, or wider units). \n\n2.  A management plan must include adequate detail on operations planned for individual operational units (stands or \n\ncompartments) but may also provide general strategies and activities planned to reach management goals. \n\n3. \n\nIncludes forest area in protected areas with management plan. \n\nINDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED FOREST MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATION \n\nForest area certified under a forest management certification scheme with published standards and is independently \nverified by a third-party. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast update: March 2019 \n\nAnnex 2 – Methodology \n\nSub-indicator 1 - Forest area annual net change rate \n\nUnit: Percent \n\nReference period: Most recent period \n\nMethod of estimation: Compound interest formula \n\nTranslation to dashboard/traffic light: \n\nThe following flowchart explains the logic behind the translation of this indicator to a \ndashboard/traffic light: \n\nForest area stable  \nor increasing \n\nLoss rate \ndecreasing \n\nForest area \ndecreasing \n\nForest area \n\nchange \ndirection \n\nChange in \nforest area \nloss rate  \n\nLoss rate stable \nor increasing \n\n \n\nThe forest area change direction is determined by examining the value of the forest area change \nrate for the most recent period, a negative value indicate a loss of forest area, a zero value \nmeans that forest area is stable and a positive value means that forest area has increased. The \nchange in forest area loss rate is based on a comparison of the current forest area net change \nrate with the baseline forest area net change rate for the period 2010-2015. \n\nComments: \n\nThis traffic light takes into consideration both the direction of forest area change (if forest area \nincreases or decreases) as well as changes in the rate of forest area loss – the latter important in \norder to indicate progress among countries that are losing forest area but manage to reduce the \nloss rate.  \n\nFor annual reporting, FAO can provide countries with imputed values based on previous trends \nthat they can use in case they don’t have new/updated information. The baseline should be \nupdated every 5 years, so in 2020 a new baseline is calculated. Also, at country level, if a country \ngets new information and updates the historical time series, the baseline for the country will be \nrecalculated, respecting the 2010-2015 period. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast update: March 2019 \n\nSub-indicator 2 – Above-ground biomass stock in forest  \n\nUnit: tonnes/hectare \n\nReference year: Latest reporting year \n\nMethod of estimation: Biomass stock in forest (tonnes) / forest area (ha) \n\nTranslation to dashboard/traffic light: \n\nThe indicator value for the latest reporting year is compared with the indicator value for \nprevious reporting year for assessment of continuity of progress since last report. \n\nThe ratio (r) between the current indicator value and the previously reported value is calculated; \nr>1 means an increase in stock per hectare, r<1 means a decrease while 1 indicates no change.
