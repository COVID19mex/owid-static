implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable \nDevelopment \nTarget 17.19: By 2030, build on existing initiatives to develop measurements of progress on sustainable \ndevelopment that complement gross domestic product, and support statistical capacity-building in \ndeveloping countries \nIndicator 17.19.1: Dollar value of all resources made available to strengthen statistical capacity in \ndeveloping countries \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \n \nPartnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century (PARIS21) \n\n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nThe indicator Dollar value of all resources made available to strengthen statistical capacity in developing \ncountries is based on the Partner Report on Support to Statistics (PRESS) that is designed and \nadministered by PARIS21 to provide a snapshot of the US dollar value of ongoing statistical support in \ndeveloping countries. \n \nRationale: \n \nThe indicator aims to provide a snapshot of the US dollar value of ongoing statistical support in \ndeveloping countries \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nMeasuring support to statistics comes with many methodological challenges. The financial figures \npresented in the PRESS therefore need to be interpreted with these challenges in mind. For instance, \nPRESS numbers rely on the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) for ODA commitments supplemented by \nvoluntary reporting from additional donors. Yet, full coverage of all programs cannot be guaranteed. \nFurthermore, the reported commitments can be seen as an upper bound to the actual support to \nstatistics for mainly three reasons. First, double counting of projects may occur when the donor and \nproject implementer report on the same project or when all project co-financers report project totals. \nSecond, the reported numbers may be inflated by working with project totals for multi-sector projects, \nwhich comprise only a small statistics component. Finally, the PRESS reports on donor-side commitments \nwhich do not always translate to actual disbursements to the recipient countries. \n \nThe indicator only captures international support to statistics and does not account for domestic \nresources. \n \n\n\f \n\nMethodology \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \nThe financial amounts were converted to US dollars by using the period average exchange rate of the \ncommitment year of the project/program. In cases where the disbursement amounts were reported, the \nexchange rate used was the period average of the disbursement year. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nThe commitment amount can be disaggregated by geographical area, ODA sectors, area of statistics and \nmethod of financing (grant vs loan). \n \nRegional aggregates: \n \nRegional-level aggregates are based on the sum of national commitments, sub-regional and regional \ncommitments. \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \n \n2016 Partner Report on Support to Statistics (PRESS) published by PARIS21 (www.paris21.org/press) \nbased on data from Creditor Reporting System (https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=CRS1) \nand PARIS21 PRESS online survey. \n \nQuality assurance \n \nInviting donors to check and validate information available online (www.paris21.org/press). \n \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nTo provide a full picture of international support to statistics, the indicator draws on three distinct data \nsources. The first source of data is the OECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS), which records data from \nOECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) members and some non-DAC donors, and provides a \ncomprehensive accounting of ODA. Donors report specific codes for the sector targeted by their aid \nactivity. Statistical capacity building (SCB) is designated by code 16062.  \n \nSecond, when SCB is a component of a larger project, it is not identified by this code, causing the CRS \nfigures to underestimate actual levels of support for international aid. PARIS21 seeks to reduce this \ndownward bias by searching project descriptions in the CRS for terms indicating a component of SCB. The \nmethodology is presented at http://www.paris21.org/PRESS2015. \n \nThird, and finally, the PARIS21 Secretariat supplements this data with an online questionnaire completed \nby a global network of reporters. The questionnaire covers a subset of the variables collected in the CRS \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\nand some additional variables specific to statistical capacity building. Reporting to the questionnaire is \nvoluntary, offering an opportunity for actors to share information on their statistical activities. Reporters \nto this questionnaire are countries that do not report to the CRS, as well as multilateral institutions with \nlarge portfolios of statistical projects that have requested to report to the PARIS21 Secretariat directly. \n \nList: \n \nOECD Creditor Reporting System (CRS), PARIS21 \n \nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \n \nThe current time series for 2006-2013 covers 132 developing countries. \n \nTime series: \n \nFrom 2006 to 2013 \n \nCalendar \n\n \nFrom Sep-16 \n \nData providers \n\n \nPARIS21/OECD \n \nData compilers \n\n \nPARIS21 \n \nReferences \n\n \nURL: \nwww.paris21.org  \n \nReferences: \n \nOECD (2007).
