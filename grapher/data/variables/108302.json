A fish stock of which abundance is at or greater \nthan the level, that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as biologically \nsustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is considered biologically \nunsustainable. \n \nRationale: \n \nThe indicator measure the sustainability of fish resources based on two major considerations: yield and \nreproduction. When a stock is fished biologically sustainable, it produces good yield without impairing \nthe stock's reproductivity, reaching a good balance between human use and ecological conservation. \n \nThe proportion is just calculated based on stock numbers, without weighting either by its production \nvolume or stock abundance, that is every fish stock is considered of the same importance. \n \nConcepts: \n \nFish stock assessment science defines the long term sustainability of fish resources as their abundance is \nfished at the level that produces the maximum sustainable level. The basic benchmarks for the \nsustainability of fisheries are set by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, Article 61(3)). \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nThe indicator measures the sustainability of fishery resources very well, and is an end-result measure of \nTarget 14.2. However, its derivation is not only data hungry, but also technically demanding as it needs \nstock assessment. This is also the reason why there is nodata at country level. \n\n\f \n\n \nMethodology \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \nFishery sustainability is defined based on stock abundance. To know stock abundance, one needs to carry \nout stock assessment that uses fish catch statistics, fishing effort data and biological information and fit \nthe data to a population dynamics model. After completing stock assessment for all stocks concerned, \nfish stocks that have abundance at or above the level associated with the maximum sustainable yield are \ncounted as biologically sustainable, and otherwise are considered as overfished. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nDisaggregation by country is not possible for the moment. \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\n \nNo interpolation is carried out for missing data. \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\n \nA fixed number of fish stocks is monitored and assessed in terms of their stock. \n\n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \nNA, as there is no national data. \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \n \nThe concept of “within biologically sustainable levels” means that abundance of the fish stock is at or \nhigher than the level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield.  \n \nWe estimated 584 fish stocks around world since 1974, representing 70% of global landings. Each stock \nwas estimated using the method described in FAO Technical Paper 569 \n(http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e.pdf). If the stock has abundance below the level that \ncan produce maximum sustainable yield, it was counted as overfished. The indicator measures the % of \nthe assessed stocks are within biologically sustainable levels.  \n \nHowever, no such assessments have been done at country level and no methods and guidance of \nassessment at country level have been established because stock assessment requires numerical \nmodelling skills and is highly data demanding so that the majority of developing countries do not have \nthe capacity of carrying out its own stock assessment. \n \nQuality assurance: \n \nNA \n\n\f \n\n \nData Sources \n\nLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n \nStock assessment needs several different kinds of data that come from different sources. For example, \ncatch data are often reported to FAO by member countries, but fishing effort data and other biological \ndata may come from other sources. A great effort must be made to collect data that are needed for stock \nassessment. Also, it is worth noting that this indicator cannot be directly calculated from the data, but \nonly through stock assessment which is a mathematical modelling process. \n \nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \n \nThe indicator has global data from 1974 to 2013. There is not systematic country data available. Regional \nbreakdown by continent is impossible as fish live in the sea. However, it is possible to bread it down to \noceans or by FAO statistical regions. \n \nTime series: \n \nFrom 1974 to 2013 \n \nCalendar \n\n \nData collection: \n \n2013, 2015 and so on (every another year)  \n \nData release: \n \n2013, 2015 and so on (every another year).  \n \nData providers \n\n \nFAO \n \nData compilers \n\n \nFAO \n \nReferences \n\n\fLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n \n\n \nURL: \n \nhttp://www.fao.org \n \nReferences: \n \nhttp://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2389e/i2389e00.htm \n \n \n \n\n\f"}}},"entityKey":{"355":{"name":"World","code":"OWID_WRL"}}}
