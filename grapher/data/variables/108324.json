implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, \nhalt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation \nglobally \nIndicator 15.2.1: Progress towards sustainable forest management  \n \nInstitutional information  \n\nOrganization(s):  \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)  \n \nConcepts and definitions  \n\nDefinition:  \n“Sustainable forest management” (SFM) is a central concept for Goal 15 and target 15.1 as well as for \ntarget 15.2. It has been formally defined, by the UN General Assembly, as follows:  \n \n[a] dynamic and evolving concept [that] aims to maintain and enhance the economic, social and \nenvironmental values of all types of forests, for the benefit of present and future generations” (Resolution \nA/RES/62/98)  \n \nThe indicator is composed of five sub-indicators that measure progress towards all dimensions of \nsustainable forest management. The environmental values of forests are covered by three sub-indicators \nfocused on the extension of forest area, biomass within the forest area and protection and maintenance \nof biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources. Social and economic values of \nforests are reconciled with environmental values through sustainable management plans. The sub-\nindicator provides further qualification to the management of forest areas, by assessing areas which are \nindependently verified for compliance with a set of national or international standards.  \n \nThe sub-indicators are:  \n1.  Forest area annual net change rate  \n2.  Above-ground biomass stock in forest  \n3.  Proportion of forest area located within legally established protect areas  \n4.  Proportion of forest area under a long term forest management plan  \n5.  Forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme  \n \nA dashboard is used to assess progress related to the five sub-indicators. The adoption of the dashboard \napproach aims at ensuring consideration of all dimensions of sustainable forest management and \nprovides for clear view of areas where progress has been achieved.  \n \n\nThe definition of SFM by the UN General Assembly contains several key aspects, notably that sustainable \nforest management is a concept which varies over time and between countries, whose circumstances – \necological, social and economic – vary widely, but that it should always address a wide range of forest \n\nRationale:  \n\n \n\n\fLast update: March 2019 \n\nvalues, including economic, social and environmental values, and take intergenerational equity into \naccount.  \n\nClearly a simple measure of forest area is insufficient to monitor sustainable forest management as a \nwhole. The significance of the five sub-indicators can be briefly explained as follows:  \n\n1.  Trends in forest area are crucial for monitoring SFM. The first sub-indicator focuses on both the \n\ndirection of change (whether there is a loss or gain in forest area) and how the change rate is \nchanging over time; the latter is important in order to capture progress among countries that are \nlosing forest area, but have managed to reduce the rate of annual forest area loss.  \n\n2.  Changes in the above-ground biomass stock in forest indicate the balance between gains in biomass \n\nstock due to forest growth and losses due to wood removals, natural losses, fire, wind, pests and \ndiseases. At country level and over a longer period, sustainable forest management would imply a \nstable or increasing biomass stock per hectare, while a long-term reduction of biomass stock per \nhectare would imply either unsustainable management of the forests and degradation or unexpected \nmajor losses due to fire, wind, pests or diseases.  \n\n3.  The change in forest area within legally protected areas is a proxy for trends in conservation of forest \n\nbiodiversity as well as cultural and spiritual values of forests and thus a clear indication of the \npolitical will to protect and conserve forests. This indicator is related to the CBD Aichi Target 11 \nwhich calls for each country to conserve at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas.  \n\n4.  The fourth sub-indicator looks at the forest area that is under a long term forest management plan. \nThe existence of a documented forest management plan is the basis for long term and sustainable \nmanagement of the forest resources for a variety of management objectives such as for wood and \nnon-wood forest products, protection of soil and water, biodiversity conservation, social and cultural \nuse, and a combination of two or several of these. An increasing area under forest management plan \nis therefore an indicator of progress towards sustainable forest management.  \n\n5.  The fifth sub-indicator is the forest area that is certified by an independently verified forest \n\nmanagement certification scheme. Such certification schemes apply standards that generally are \nhigher than those established by the countries’ own normative frameworks, and compliance is \nverified by an independent and accredited certifier. An increase in certified forest area therefore \nprovides an additional indication of progress towards sustainable forest management. It should \nhowever be noted that there are significant areas of sustainably managed forest which are not \ncertified, either because their owners have chosen not to seek certification (which is voluntary and \nmarket-based) or because no credible or affordable certification scheme is in place for that area.  \n\n \nConcepts:  \nSee Annex 1 with Terms and Definitions.  \n \nComments and limitations:  \nThe five sub-indicators chosen to illustrate progress towards sustainable forest management do not fully \ncover all aspects of sustainable forest management. In particular, social and economic aspects are \nsummarized under the sub-indicators on areas under sustainable forest management plans. Furthermore, \nas the trends are calculated using only those countries which have data complete time series, different \nsub-indicators may reflect different sets of countries.  \n \n\n \n\n\fWhile the dashboard illustrates the progress on the individual sub-indicators, there is no weighting of the \nrelative importance of the sub-indicators.  \n\nLast update: March 2019 \n\n \nMethodology  \n\nComputation Method:  \nNational data on forest area, biomass stock, forest area within protected areas, and forest area under \nmanagement plan are reported directly by countries to FAO for pre-established reference years. Based on \nthe country reported data, FAO then makes country-level estimates of the forest area net change rate \nusing the compound interest formula. The proportion of forest area within protected area and under \nmanagement plan is calculated using the reported areas and the official FAOSTAT land area for reference \nyear 2015. Data on forest area under an independently verified forest management certification scheme \nare reported to FAO by the head offices of respective forest certification scheme, who are jointly \nadjusting the figures to remove any double accounting.  \n\nNo dashboard traffic lights are made at country level.  \n\n \nDisaggregation:  \nNo further disaggregation of this indicator.  \n\n \nTreatment of missing values:  \n•  At country level  \n\nFor countries and territories where no information was provided to FAO for FRA 2015 (79 countries \nand territories representing 1.2 percent of the global forest area), a report was prepared by FAO \nusing existing information from previous assessments and literature search.  \n\n•  At regional and global levels  \n\nSee above.  \n\nRegional aggregates:  \nSee Annex 2 – Methodology. It should be noted that for those sub-indicators where there are gaps in the \ndata set, only the countries that reported a complete time series are included in the regional and global \naggregates. Annex 2 also shows how the dashboard traffic lights are applied at global and regional level.  \n\nSources of discrepancies:  \nThe national figures in the database are reported by the countries themselves following a standardized \nformat, definitions and reporting years, thus eliminating any discrepancies between global and national \nfigures. The reporting format ensures that countries provide the full reference for original data sources as \nwell as national definitions and terminology. Separate sections in the reporting format (country reports) \ndeal with the analysis of data (including any assumptions made and the methods used for estimates and \nprojections to the common reporting years); calibration of data to the official land area as held by FAO; \nand reclassification of data to the classes used in FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessments.  \n\nRegarding the data on forest area under an independently verified forest management certification \nscheme, these are usually not part of official national statistics, and are maintained by local offices of the \nrespective certification schemes. They in turn report their data to their head offices. As certified forest \narea is dynamic and can change monthly as some certificates expire and new certificates come. \n\n \n\n\fLast update: March 2019 \n\nTherefore, the data are requested to correspond to the end of June each year. However, the data are not \nalways reported by the local offices according to that date.  \n\n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level:  \nData on sub-indicators 1 to 4 are provided to FAO by countries in the form of a country report following a \nstandard format, which includes the original data and reference sources and descriptions of how these \nhave been used to estimate the forest area for different points in time.  \n\nDetailed methodology and guidance on how to prepare the country reports and to convert national data \naccording to national categories and definitions to FAO’s global categories and definitions is found in the \ndocument “Guide for country reporting for FRA 2015”, http://www.fao.org/3/a-au190e.pdf.  \n\nQuality assurance  \nOnce received, the country reports undergo a rigorous review process to ensure correct use of definitions \nand methodology as well as internal consistency. A comparison is made with past assessments and other \nexisting data sources. Regular contacts between national correspondents and FAO staff by e-mail and \nregional/sub-regional review workshops form part of this review process.  \n\nAll country reports (including those prepared by FAO) are sent to the respective Head of Forestry for \nvalidation before finalization and publishing of data. The data are then aggregated at sub-regional, \nregional and global levels by the FRA team at FAO.  \n\nData Sources  \n\nSub-indicators 1 to 4 \n\nDescription:  \nData on the sub-indicators are collected periodically (until now every 5 years) by FAO’s Global Forest \nResources Assessment (FRA) programme. All data are provided to FAO by countries in the form of a \ncountry report following a standard format, which includes the original data and reference sources and \ndescriptions of how these have been used to estimate the forest area for different points in time.  \n\nCollection process:  \nOfficially nominated national correspondents and their teams prepare the country reports for the \nassessment. Some prepare more than one report as they also report on dependent territories. For the \nremaining countries and territories where no information is provided, a report is prepared by FAO using \nexisting information and a literature search.  \n\nIn order to obtain internationally comparable data, countries are requested to provide national \ncategories and definitions, and in case these are different than the FAO categories and definitions, \ncountries are requested to perform a reclassification of national data to correspond to the FAO \ncategories and definitions and to document this step in the country report. Countries are also requested \nto use interpolation or extrapolation of national data in order to provide estimates for the specific \nreporting years.  \n\nSub-indicator 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast update: March 2019 \n\nData on forest certification is submitted annually to FAO by the head offices of the respective forest \ncertification scheme. Data include the area certified by each scheme, as well as areas that are double-\ncertified by the two main schemes. That allows for estimating the total certified forest area, adjusted for \ndouble certified area.  \n\nCurrently, forest certification by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the \nEndorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) are included in the data submissions. The latter includes \nseveral national/regional certification schemes that have been endorsed according to the PEFC standards.  \n\nData reported by the certification bodies and consolidated into estimates of total certified forest area are \nmade available to the countries through an online platform where country officials can view the data that \nare being submitted.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast update: March 2019 \n\nData Availability  \n\nDescription:  \nBreakdown of the number of countries covered by region and by sub-indicator is as follows:  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal number of countries / territoriesForest area change rateBiomass stockForest area within legally protected areasForest area under management planForest area under an an independently verified forest management certification schemeForest area change rateBiomass stockForest area within legally protected areasForest area under management planForest area under an an independently verified forest management certification schemeWorld234234176162121234100%75%69%52%100%Africa585852484058100%90%83%69%100%Northern Africa777557100%100%71%71%100%Sub-Saharan Africa515145433551100%88%84%69%100%Eastern Africa202016181020100%80%90%50%100%Middle Africa999779100%100%78%78%100%Southern Africa555545100%100%100%80%100%Western Africa171715131417100%88%76%82%100%Americas535329351753100%55%66%32%100%Latin America and the Caribbean484827321548100%56%67%31%100%Caribbean2626911526100%35%42%19%100%Latin America222218211022100%82%95%45%100%Northern America552325100%40%60%40%100%Asia484836302348100%75%63%48%100%Central Asia555335100%100%60%60%100%Eastern Asia553445100%60%80%80%100%Southern Asia998549100%89%56%44%100%South-Eastern Asia111199411100%82%82%36%100%Western Asia1818119818100%61%50%44%100%Europe505044383450100%88%76%68%100%Eastern Europe1010109910100%100%90%90%100%Northern Europe151511101015100%73%67%67%100%Southern Europe16161412816100%88%75%50%100%Western Europe999779100%100%78%78%100%Oceania25251511725100%60%44%28%100%Australia and New Zealand331223100%33%67%67%100%Melanesia553325100%60%60%40%100%Micronesia776117100%86%14%14%100%Polynesia101055210100%50%50%20%100%Number of countries reporting latest yearRegionNumber of countries reporting latest year (%)\fLast update: March 2019 \n\nTime series:  \n2000, 2005, 2010, 2015  \nAfter next data release (2020) annual data will be available from 2015 and onwards. \n \nCalendar  \n\nData collection:  \nSource data collection was initiated in 2018 and will conclude in 2019.  \nData release:  \nExpected dates of release of new data: 2020  \n \nData providers  \n\nNational Forest Authorities, through officially nominated National Correspondents to FRA.  \nHead offices of respective forest certification scheme. \n \nData compilers  \n\nFood and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)  \n \nReferences  \n\nURL: http://www.fao.org/forest-resources-assessment/en/   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast update: March 2019 \n\nAnnex 1 – Terms and Definitions1  \n\n \n\nFOREST \n\nExplanatory notes \n\nLand spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or \ntrees able to reach these thresholds in situ.
