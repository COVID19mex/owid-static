inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive \nemployment and decent work for all \nTarget 8.8: Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, \nincluding migrant workers, in particular women migrants, and those in precarious employment \nIndicator 8.8.1: Frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries, by sex and migrant \nstatus \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \nILO \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \nThe frequency rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries provide information on the number of \ncases of fatal and non-fatal occupational injury per hours worked by the concerned population during the \nreference period. It is a measure of the risk of having a fatal or a non-fatal occupational injury based on \nthe duration of exposure to adverse work-related factors. \n \nThe incidence rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries provide information on the number of \ncases of fatal and non-fatal occupational injury per workers in the reference group during the reference \nperiod. It is a measure of the personal likelihood of the workers in the reference group of suffering from \nwork-related injuries. \n \nFor the purposes of international reporting on the SDG indicators, incidence rates are used, even though \nthe indicator title of 8.8.1 calls for the use of frequency rates, as common practices around the world and \ndata availability favour incidence rates. \n \nRationale: \nThis indicator provides valuable information that could be used to formulate policies and programmes for \nthe prevention of occupational injuries, diseases and deaths. It could also be used to monitor the \nimplementation of these programmes and to signal particular areas of increasing risk such as a particular \noccupation, industry or location. Although the principal objective of this indicator is to provide \ninformation for prevention purposes, it may be used for a number of other purposes, such as to identify \nthe occupations and economic activities with the highest risk of occupational injuries; to detect changes \nin the pattern and occurrence of occupational injuries, so as to monitor improvements in safety and \nreveal any new areas of risk; to inform employers, employers’ organizations, workers and workers’ \norganizations of the risks associated with their work and workplaces, so that they can take an active part \nin their own safety; to evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures; to estimate the consequences \nof occupational injuries, particularly in terms of days lost or costs; and to provide a basis for policymaking \naimed at encouraging employers, employers’ organizations, workers and workers’ organizations to \nintroduce accident prevention measures. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: March 2019 \n\nConcepts: \nDefinitions of the main concepts presented below are derived from the Resolution concerning statistics \nof occupational injuries (resulting from occupational accidents), adopted by the 16th ICLS in 1998 \n(http://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-guidelines/resolutions-adopted-\nbyinternational-conferences-of-labour-statisticians/WCMS_087528/lang--en/index.htm). \n \nOccupational accident: an unexpected and unplanned occurrence, including acts of violence, arising out \nof or in connection with work which results in one or more workers incurring a personal injury, disease or \ndeath. Occupational accidents are to be considered travel, transport or road traffic accidents in which \nworkers are injured and which arise out of or in the course of work; that is, while engaged in an economic \nactivity, or at work, or carrying out the business of the employer. \n \nOccupational injury: any personal injury, disease or death resulting from an occupational accident. An \noccupational injury is different from an occupational disease, which comes as a result of an exposure over \na period of time to risk factors linked to the work activity. Diseases are included only in cases where the \ndisease arose as a direct result of an accident. An occupational injury can be fatal or non-fatal (and non-\nfatal injuries could entail the loss of work days). \n \nFatal occupational injury: an occupational injury leading to death within one year of the day of the \noccupational accident. \n \nCase of occupational injury: the case of one worker incurring one or more occupational injuries as a result \nof one occupational accident.  \n \nWorkers in the reference group: workers in the reference group refer to the average number of workers \nin the particular group under consideration and who are covered by the source of the statistics on \noccupational injuries (for example, those of a specific sex or in a specific economic activity, occupation, \nregion, age group, or any combination of these, or those covered by a particular insurance scheme, \naccident notification systems, or household or establishment survey). \n \nComments and limitations: \nThere may be problems of under reporting of occupational injuries, and proper systems should be put in \nplace to ensure the best reporting and data quality. Under reporting is thought to be present in countries \nat all levels of development, but may be particularly problematic in some developing countries. Data \nusers should be aware of this issue when analysing the data. \nDouble-counting of cases of occupational injury may also happen in cases where data from several \nregistries (records kept by different agencies, for example) are consolidated to have more comprehensive \nstatistics. \n \nBecause data quality issues may be present, it may be more relevant to analyse indicator trends rather \nthan levels. When measured over a period of time, the data can reveal progress or deterioration in \noccupational safety and health, and thus point to the effectiveness of prevention measures. This indicator \nis volatile and strong annual fluctuations may occur due to unexpected but significant accidents or \nnational calamities. The underlying trend should therefore be analysed. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: March 2019 \n\nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \nThe frequency and incidence rates of fatal and non-fatal occupational injuries will be calculated \nseparately, since statistics on fatal injuries tend to come from a different source than those on non-fatal \ninjuries, which would make their sum into total occupational accidents inaccurate. \n \nThe fatal occupational injury frequency rate is expressed per 1’000’000 hours worked by the workers in \nthe reference group. Thus, it is calculated as follows: \n \n\nFatal occupational injury frequency rate \n\nNew cases of fatal injury during the reference year\n\ntotal number of hours worked by workers in the reference group during the reference year\n\n \n \nSimilarly, the non-fatal occupational injury frequency rate is calculated as follows: \n\nNon fatal occupational injury frequency rate \n\nNew cases of non fatal injury during the reference year\n\ntotal number of hours worked by workers in the reference group during the reference year\n\n× 1′000′000 \n\n=  \n\n=  \n\n× 1′000′000 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nIdeally, the denominator should be the number of hours actually worked by workers in the reference \ngroup. When this is not possible, the denominator can be calculated on the basis of normal hours of work \ntaking into account entitlements to periods of paid absence from work, such as paid vacations, paid sick \nleave and public holidays. \n \nIf the data needed to calculate frequency rates is not available, incidence rates may be calculated instead. \nIndeed, incidence rates are used for the purposes of international reporting on this indicator rather than \nfrequency rates. \n \nThe fatal occupational injury incidence rate is expressed per 100’000 workers in the reference group, and \nthus, is calculated as follows: \n \n\nFatal occupational injury incidence rate \n\nNew cases of fatal injury during the reference year\n\nWorkers in the reference group during the reference year\n\n  × 100′000 \n\n \n \nSimilarly, the non-fatal occupational injury incidence rate is calculated as follows: \n \n\nNon fatal occupational injury incidence rate \n\nNew cases of non fatal injury during the reference year\n\nWorkers in the reference group during the reference year\n\n  × 100′000 \n\n=  \n\n=  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: March 2019 \n\nIn calculating the average number of workers, the number of part-time workers should be converted to \nfull-time equivalents. For the calculation of rates, the numerator and the denominator should have the \nsame coverage. For example, if self-employed persons are not covered by the source of statistics on fatal \noccupational injuries, they should also be taken out of the denominator. \n \nDisaggregation: \nThis indicator should be disaggregated by both sex and migrant status. \nWherever possible, it would also be useful to have information disaggregated by economic activity and \noccupation. \n \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\n \n\n \n\nRegional aggregates: \n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \nThis indicator could come from a variety of sources at the national level, including various kinds of \nadministrative records (insurance records, labour inspection records, etc.), household surveys and \nestablishment surveys. \n\n- \n\n- \n\n- \n\nILO Guidebook - Decent Work and the Sustainable Development Goals: A Guidebook on SDG \nLabour Market Indicators (https://www.ilo.org/stat/Publications/WCMS_647109/lang--\nen/index.htm ) \nILO Manual – Decent Work Indicators, Concepts and Definitions – Chapter 8, Safe work \nenvironment http://www.ilo.org/integration/resources/pubs/WCMS_229374/lang-- \nen/index.htm  (second version, page 156) \nResolution concerning statistics of occupational injuries (resulting from occupational \naccidents) http://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/standards-and-\nguidelines/resolutionsadopted-by-international-conferences-of-labour-\nstatisticians/WCMS_087528/lang--en/index.htm  \n\n-  Global database on occupational safety and health legislation - LEGOSH \nhttp://www.ilo.org/safework/info/publications/WCMS_217849/lang--en/index.htm  \n-  Occupational injuries statistics from household surveys and establishment surveys \nhttp://www.ilo.org/stat/Publications/WCMS_173153/lang--en/index.htm  \nILOSTAT (www.ilo.org/ilostat) \nILOSTAT Metadata – Indicator descriptions (http://www.ilo.org/ilostat-\nfiles/Documents/description_INJ_EN.pdf) \n\n- \n- \n\n \nQuality assurance \nData consistency and quality checks regularly conducted for validation of the data before dissemination \nin the ILOSTAT database. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: March 2019 \n\nData reported to the ILO Department of Statistics through its annual questionnaire on labour statistics, by \nnational statistical offices or other relevant national agencies, or compiled from official national, regional \nor international publications.  \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \nThe recommended data sources are different types of administrative records, such as records of national \nsystems for the notification of occupational injuries (labour inspection records and annual reports; \ninsurance and compensation records, death registers), supplemented by household surveys (especially in \norder to cover informal sector enterprises and the self-employed) and/or establishment surveys. \nThe metadata should clearly specify (i) whether the statistics relate to cases of occupational injury which \nhave been reported (to an accident notification system or to an accident compensation scheme), \ncompensated (by an accident insurance scheme) or identified in some other way (for example through a \nsurvey of households or establishments) and (ii) whether cases of occupational disease and cases of \ninjury due to commuting accidents are excluded from the statistics, as recommended. \n \nCollection process: \nThe ILO Department of Statistics sends out its annual questionnaire on labour statistics to all relevant \nagencies within each country (national statistical office, labour ministry, etc.) requesting the latest annual \ndata available and any revisions on numerous labour market topics and indicators, including many SDG \nindicators.
