(2017). Global Carbon Project. This is given as production (territorial) emissions in addition to trade-adjusted consumption-based emissions. Consumption-based emissions are national or regional emissions which have been adjusted for trade (i.e. territorial/production emissions minus emissions embedded in exports, plus emissions embedded in imports). If a country's consumption-based emissions are higher than its production emissions it is a net importer of carbon dioxide.\n\nNote that consumption-based emissions are not available for all countries; although those without complete data are a small fraction (3%) of the global total. Each country's share of world emissions are based on the share of the global total minus categories termed 'bunkers' and 'statistical differences' (which include cross-boundary emissions such as international travel and shipping.\n\nCalculation of each country's share of the global population is calculated using national and global population figures from the UN World Population Prospects (UNWPPP, 2018). \n\nFull reference for the Global Carbon Project:\nFull reference: Le Quéré, Corinne, Robbie M.
