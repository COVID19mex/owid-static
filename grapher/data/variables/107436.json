These indicators \n\nwill eventually reflect the agreements on the Sendai Framework indicators. \n\nThe indicator will build bridge between the SDGs and the Sendai Framework for DRR.

During the four reporting cycles to 2015 the HFA Monitor has generated the \n\nworld’s largest repository of information on national DRR policy inter alia. Its successor, provisionally \n\nnamed the Sendai Monitor, is under development and will be informed by the recommendations of the \n\nOEIWG. A baseline as of 2015 is expected to be created in 2016-2017 that will facilitate reporting on \n\nprogress in achieving the relevant targets of both the Sendai Framework and the SDGs. \n\nDefinition: \n\nNA \n\nRationale: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: 07 July 2017 \n\nMembers of both the OEIWG and the IAEG-SDGs have addressed that indicators that simply count the \n\nnumber of countries are not recommended, instead that, indicators to measure progress over time have \n\nbeen promoted. Further to the deliberations of the OEIWG as well as the IAEG, UNISDR has proposed \n\ncomputation methodologies that allow the monitoring of improvement in national and local DRR \n\nstrategies over time. These methodologies range from a simple quantitative assessment of the number of \n\nthese strategies to a qualitative measure of alignment with the Sendai Framework, as well as population \n\ncoverage for local strategies. \n\n \nMethodology \n\nComputation Method: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNote: Computation methodology for several indicators is very comprehensive, very long (about 180 \n\npages) and probably out of the scope of this Metadata.
