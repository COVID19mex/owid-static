For example, in the United Nations principles and recommendations for census taking, only registered partnerships and consensual unions that are legal and binding under law should be reported. However, there is considerable variation among the definitions and terminology used in surveys. The Demographic and Health Surveys, one of the major sources of data on marital and union status, ask individuals whether they are married or ‘living together’ with a partner; however, in countries with low prevalence of cohabiting unions, the survey question is normally limited only to marriage.\n\nFor a breakdown of countries by region see the UN Methodology page <a href=\"https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/overview/\">here</a>.\n\n<strong>Data is estimated until 2010, and projected for 2020 and 2030. </strong>"}}},"entityKey":{"295":{"name":"South America","code":null},"355":{"name":"World","code":"OWID_WRL"},"436":{"name":"Caribbean","code":null},"450":{"name":"Northern America","code":null},"462":{"name":"Eastern Africa","code":null},"463":{"name":"Middle Africa","code":null},"464":{"name":"Northern Africa","code":null},"465":{"name":"Southern Africa","code":null},"466":{"name":"Western Africa","code":null},"467":{"name":"Eastern Asia","code":null},"468":{"name":"South-Central Asia","code":null},"471":{"name":"South-Eastern Asia","code":null},"472":{"name":"Western Asia","code":null},"473":{"name":"Eastern Europe","code":null},"474":{"name":"Northern Europe","code":null},"475":{"name":"Southern Europe","code":null},"476":{"name":"Western Europe","code":null},"477":{"name":"Central America","code":null},"478":{"name":"Melanesia","code":"OWID_MNS"},"479":{"name":"Polynesia","code":"OWID_PYA"},"35355":{"name":"Micronesia","code":null},"96956":{"name":"Australia/ New Zealand","code":null}}}
