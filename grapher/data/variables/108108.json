16 October 2018 \n\nGoal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns \nTarget 12.c: Rationalize inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption by removing \nmarket distortions, in accordance with national circumstances, including by restructuring taxation and \nphasing out those harmful subsidies, where they exist, to reflect their environmental impacts, taking fully \ninto account the specific needs and conditions of developing countries and minimizing the possible \nadverse impacts on their development in a manner that protects the poor and the affected communities \nIndicator 12.c.1: Amount of fossil-fuel subsidies per unit of GDP (production and consumption) and \nas a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil fuels \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \nUN Environment (United Nations Environment Programme) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \nIn order to measure fossil fuel subsidies at the national, regional and global level, three sub-indicators are \nrecommended for reporting on this indicator: 1) direct transfer of government funds; 2) induced transfers \n(price support); and as an optional sub-indicator 3) tax expenditure, other revenue foregone, and under-\npricing of goods and services. The definitions of the IEA Statistical Manual (IEA, 2005) and the Agreement \non Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) under the World Trade Organization (WTO) (WTO, \n1994) are used to define fossil fuel subsidies. Standardised descriptions from the United Nations \nStatistical Office’s Central Product Classification should be used to classify individual energy products. It is \nproposed to drop the wording “as a proportion of total national expenditure on fossil fuels” and thus this \nindicator is effectively \"Amount of fossil fuel subsidies per unit of GDP (production and consumption)\". \n  \nRationale: \nThe scale and impact of fossil fuel subsidies presents both challenges and opportunities for achieving the \ngoals of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development. For one, the use of fossil fuels, and their \npromotion through subsidy schemes, adversely affects the ability of governments to attain key goals, \nsuch as reducing poverty, improving health, reaching gender equality, providing access to energy, and \naddressing climate change. At the same time, there is a need to ensure that poor households that are \nparticularly vulnerable to price increases obtain or retain access to energy. Energy-dependent sectors of \nthe economy can be affected, particularly by abrupt changes in prices. Any successful reform therefore \nrequires careful analysis and adapted mitigation measures. For another, reallocating fossil fuel subsidies \nto sectors that are relevant for development could give a boost to reaching the SDGs.  \n \nAwareness and understanding of existing subsidies based on credible data is necessary to increase \ntransparency and inform decision-making. Reporting against a global indicator measuring consumer and \nproducer fossil fuel subsidies provides a global picture that encompasses both consumer and producer \nsubsidies. It allows for tracking of national and global trends and serve as an important guide for policy-\nmaking.  \n \nConcepts: \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 16 October 2018 \n\nThe  concepts  and  definitions  used  in  the  methodology  have  been  based  on  existing  international \nframeworks and glossaries. \n\n•  Use  definition  of  fossil  fuels  from  IEA  Statistics  Manual,  “Fossil  fuels  are  taken  from  natural \nresources which were formed from biomass in the geological past. By extension, the term fossil is \nalso applied to any secondary fuel manufactured from a fossil fuel.” \n\n•  Use the terms set out in CPC Rev. 2.1 for the statistical classification of the individual products. No \n\n• \n\nother commonly accepted definition identified \nInclude electricity and heat generated from fossil fuels in the scope of fossil fuels.  \nInclude non-energy uses with monitoring optional for the measuring of this indicator. \n\n• \n•  Additional details are provided in the methodological document entitled, Measuring Fossil Fuel \n\nSubsidies in the Context of the Sustainable Development Goals. \n\n \nComments and limitations: \nThe monitoring and reporting of SDG Indicator 12.c.1 requires capacity within national statistical systems \nto evaluate direct and indirect transfers of government funds. Data collection by the statistical agencies \nfrom the sectoral ministries and state-owned enterprises, including at the sub-national level, which \ndepends on their capacity. There is a need for additional training materials and sharing of experiences on \nthe indicator. \n \nThe indicator methodology utilizes a phased monitoring to allow for countries with different capacities to \nengage in monitoring 12.c.1. The two phases include global monitoring based on price gap estimates plus \nnational monitoring of direct and indirect transfers with optional monitoring of tax expenditure foregone. \n \nMethodology \n\nDirect transfers;  \nInduced transfers (reporting on regulated prices and calculation of the total amount); \nTax expenditure, other government revenue foregone and under-pricing of goods and services, \n\nComputation Method: \nIt is proposed that countries report on the subsidy categories listed below as sub-indicators. \n- \n- \n- \nincluding risk (optional).  \n \nThe last category should be included as an optional sub-indicator. Each sub-indicator should be expressed \nin national currency or United States dollars in current prices. UN Environment will use market exchange \nrates to calculate between national currency and United States dollar.  \n \nCare should be given if a country chooses to aggregate across the three sub-indicators in order to avoid \ndouble counting and all three sub-indicators should be publicly available to ensure transparency.  Care \nneeds to be taken when aggregating estimates of induced transfers with data on direct transfers and \nsome measures in under-pricing of goods and services.  \n \nEstimates of subsidies to consumers observable through price-gaps (i.e., consumer price support) have \nbeen calculated by several international organizations (IADB, IEA, and IMF), covering different geographic \nregions and time-periods. The three organisations that produce these estimates use roughly the same \napproach, which can be summed up by the following equation: \n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 16 October 2018 \n\nConsumer price support = (adjusted net-of-tax reference unit price – local net-of-tax unit price) x units \nsubsidized \n \nEstimates are based on reference prices on import (or export) parity prices using the price of a product at \nthe nearest international hub, adjusted for quality differences if necessary, plus (or minus) the cost of \nfreight and insurance to the net importer (or back to the net exporter), plus the cost of internal \ndistribution and marketing and any value-added tax (VAT). For tradable commodities (mainly coal, crude \noil, and petroleum products), the reference prices are based on the spot price at the nearest \ninternational hub – e.g., the United States, Northwest Europe, or Singapore. \n \nDisaggregation: \nBecause of the risk of double counting, the dataset should therefore provide disaggregated information \non individual subsidy measures that will be reported as sub-indicators by category of subsidies. \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\nMissing values are not imputed.  \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\nA price gap method is used to create national, regional and global estimates. \n \nRegional aggregates: \nThe methodology used for the calculation of the regional/global aggregates from the country values \nis available at http://pre-uneplive.unep.org/media/docs/graphs/aggregation_methods.pdf.  \n \nSources of discrepancies: \nCountry level data and price gap data are shown separately, thus this should not apply.  \n \nData Sources \n\nDescription: \nDirect transfers are generally reported in government budgets, and well documented in sectoral and \nFinance Ministries, broken down by programme if not by fuel. Those that meet the SNA definition of \n“subsidies” – i.e., subsidies on products, and other subsidies on production – can also be found in a \ncountry’s System of National Accounts. Budget documents are publicly available for most countries.  The \ndegree to which information on individual programmes is itemized in those reports is highly variable, \nhowever. Support to corporations involved in energy production or transformation may sometimes be \nfound in their annual reports, for example. In some cases, researchers may be able to obtain unpublished \ndata from state-owned energy enterprises directly. \n \nInduced transfer are measured by calculating the price-gap between the producer or consumer price and \na reference price, and multiplying that differential by the affected volume produced or consumed.  \n \nMeasuring the value of special features introduced into the tax code to favour certain industries or \nactivities of those industries (such as investment in productive capital) can be a complex endeavour. \nSome countries do this exercise already, and report the annual value of those tax features in their \nperiodic tax-expenditure reports. Where that is not the case, the analysist must construct a model and \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 16 October 2018 \n\nestimate the difference in the revenues that would be owed to the government under the baseline \nconditions and with the special tax feature. \n \nFossil fuel subsidies should be monitored on an annual basis. \n    \nCollection process: \nThe data will be collected by UN Environment through electronic reporting being developed by UN \nEnvironment.  \n \nData Availability \n\nDescription: \nAn initial baseline data assessment of data availability demonstrates that 99 countries have existing data \nwhich  can  be  used  to  estimate  fossil  fuels  from  direct  transfer  and  many  of  these  countries  also  have \ninformation on tax revenue foregone. Data on induced transfers using a price gap approach is available for \nall UN member states. \n \nTime series: \nThe reporting on this indicator will follow an annual cycle with initial reporting on induced transfers starting \nin 2018. Data on direct transfers and tax revenue foregone will be in place by 2020. \n \nCalendar \n\nData collection: \nAnnual  with  reporting  on  induced  transfers  starting  in  2018.  Data  on  direct  transfers  and  tax  revenue \nforegone will be in place by 2020. \n\n \n\n \nData release: \nAnnual. \n \nData providers \n\nIMF and IEA \n \n\nData compilers \n\n1.
