December 2018 \n\nGoal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries \nTarget 10.5: Improve the regulation and monitoring of global financial markets and institutions and \nstrengthen the implementation of such regulations \nIndicator 10.5.1: Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \nInternational Monetary Fund \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n- Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets  \n- Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets  \n- Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital  \n- Nonperforming loans to total gross loans  \n- Return on assets  \n- Liquid assets to short-term liabilities  \n- Net open position in foreign exchange to capital  \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nSeven FSIs are included as SDG indicators for 10.5.1 and expressed as percent. \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: This is the ratio of the core capital (Tier 1) to total (balance sheet) \nassets.   \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It is calculated using total regulatory Tier 1 capital as \nthe numerator and risk-weighted assets as the denominator. The data for this FSI are compiled in \naccordance with the guidelines of either Basel I, Basel II, or Basel III.  \n  \nNonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is calculated by taking the value of \nnonperforming loans (NPLs) less the value of specific loan loss provisions as the numerator and capital as \nthe denominator. Capital is measured as total regulatory capital.  \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is calculated by using the value of NPLs as the \nnumerator and the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and before the deduction of specific \nloan- loss provisions) as the denominator.  \n  \nReturn on assets: This FSI is calculated by dividing annualized net income before extraordinary items and \ntaxes (as recommended in the FSI Guide) by the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) \nover the same period.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: This FSI is calculated by using the core measure of liquid assets as \nthe numerator and short-term liabilities as the denominator. The ratio can also be calculated by taking \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nthe broad measure of liquid assets as the numerator. For jurisdictions that have implemented Basel III, \nthis indicator could be supplemented with the liquidity coverage ratio. \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange should be \ncalculated based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital \nshould be total regulatory capital as net open position in foreign exchange is a supervisory concept.   \n \nRationale: \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: It is a more stringent version of the leverage ratio and indicates the \nextent to which assets are funded by other than own funds and is a measure of capital adequacy of the \ndeposit-taking sector.   \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It measures the capital adequacy of deposit takers \nbased on the core capital concept of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital \nadequacy and availability ultimately determine the degree of robustness of financial institutions to \nwithstand shocks to their balance sheets.  \n  \nNonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is a capital adequacy ratio and is an important \nindicator of the capacity of bank capital to withstand losses from NPLs that are not covered by specific \nloan loss provisions.  \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is often used as a proxy for asset quality and is \nintended to identify problems with asset quality in the loan portfolio.  \n  \nReturn on assets: It is an indicator of bank profitability and is intended to measure deposit takers’ \nefficiency in using their assets.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: It is a liquid asset ratio and is intended to capture the liquidity \nmismatch of assets and liabilities and provides an indication of the extent to which deposit takers can \nmeet the short-term withdrawal of funds without facing liquidity problems.  \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: This FSI is an indicator of sensitivity to market risk, \nwhich is intended to gauge deposit takers’ exposure to exchange rate risk compared with capital. It \nmeasures the mismatch of foreign currency asset and liability positions to assess the vulnerability to \nexchange rate movements. \n \nConcepts: \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, II, or III \ndepending on countries’ supervisory practices. Denominator is total balance sheet (non-risk weighted) \nassets.  \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, \nII, or III depending on countries’ supervisory practices. Denominator is risk-weighted assets also \ncalculated based on Basel standards.  \n  \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nNonperforming loans (NPLs) net of provisions to capital: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of \nprincipal or interest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a \nloan is not going to be recovered. Only specific loan loss provisions are used in this calculation and they \nrefer charges against the value of specific loans. Data exclude accrued interest in NPLs. Capital is \nmeasured as total regulatory capital calculated based on Basel I, II, or III depending on countries’ \nsupervisory practices. \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of principal or \ninterest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a loan is not \ngoing to be recovered. The denominator is the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and \nbefore the deduction of specific loan- loss provisions).  \n  \nReturn on assets: The numerator is annualized net income before extraordinary items and taxes. The \ndenominator is the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) over the same period.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: Core measure of liquid assets includes currency and deposits and \nother financial assets available on demand or within three months. Broad measures equal core measure \nplus securities traded in liquid markets that can be converted into cash with minimal change in value. The \ndenominator is short-term elements of debt liabilities plus net (short-term) market value of financial \nderivatives position. The latter is calculated as financial derivatives liability position minus financial \nderivative asset position. Short-term refers to three months and should be defined on a remaining \nmaturity basis. If remaining maturity is not available, original maturity can be used as an alternative. \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange equals the \nforeign-currency and foreign-currency linked element of balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet \nexposures minus the foreign-currency and foreign-currency linked element of balance sheet liabilities and \noff-balance sheet exposures. Foreign-currency-linked instruments refer to accounts denominated in \nnational currency, but their payments are linked to exchange rates, thus subject to foreign exchange risk. \nThe denominator is total regulatory capital as defined above.   \n   \nComments and limitations: \n \nData for most countries are reported on a monthly or quarterly basis; a few countries report data on a \nsemi-annual basis and with a lag of more than a quarter. As of end-December 2018, there were 138 FSI \nreporters. Some countries’ compilation practices deviate from the FSI Guide methodology in certain areas \nand are documented in the FSI metadata also posted on the IMF’s FSI website. Reporting countries \nprovide all or most core FSIs and some encouraged FSIs that can be used to support the interpretation of \nthese seven SDG indicators. FSI data and metadata reported by countries are available at \nhttp://data.imf.org/FSI. \n \n \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nThe calculation of the seven FSIs is detailed in section on “Definition” above. The common source data \nare data reported by banks to supervisory authorities, which are usually the FSI compilers.   \n \nDisaggregation: \nThe FSIs disseminated by the IMF are weighted averages for the sector as a whole (e.g., deposit takers, \nother financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations). Data for parent banks, their branches, and \nrelevant subsidiaries are consolidated; if this consolidation is not possible or not applicable, an \nexplanation is provided in the metadata. There are no disaggregated breakdowns of the FSIs reported to \nthe IMF. \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\nIt is not relevant to the seven FSIs. Source data are collected by banks’ supervisory authorities and \ncomplete reporting is usually mandated by law. \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n      The FSIs are not compiled at regional or global levels. \n\n \n\nRegional aggregates: \nThe FSIs are not aggregated at regional levels. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \nData calculated by other sources could be different from the FSIs disseminated by the IMF due to the use \nof different compilation methodology and/or institutional coverage. The FSIs disseminated by the IMF are \ncompiled based on the FSI Compilation Guide, which provides the guidance on the concepts and \ndefinitions, and sources and techniques for the compilation of cross-country comparable data to support \nnational and international surveillance of financial systems. To facilitate identification of possible \ndiscrepancies across countries, reporters provide metadata to the IMF that detail departures from \nrecommendations in the FSI Guide. \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \n\n• \n\nThe FSI Compilation Guide (206) available at http://data.imf.org/FSI. \n\nQuality assurance \n\n•  The common source data are data reported by banks for supervisory purposes. National \n\nsupervisors check and validate the data that are used by national FSI compilers. IMF staff check \nthe FSIs reported by countries before posting on the FSI website and address data issues in \ncollaboration with the national compilers whenever such issues are flagged by the validation and \nconsistency checks implemented in the IMF data processing system..   \n\n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nThe common source data are data reported by banks for supervisory purposes. They include balance \nsheet, income statement, and supervisory series (such as Tier 1 capital, Tier 2 capital, risk-weighted \nassets). \nCollection process: \nThe national central banks or supervisory agencies collect these data for supervisory purposes, and these \ndata are used for FSI compilation. \nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \nAs of end-December 2018, there were 138 FSI reporters.

and among countries \nTarget 10.5: Improve the regulation and monitoring of global financial markets and institutions and \nstrengthen the implementation of such regulations \nIndicator 10.5.1: Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \nInternational Monetary Fund \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n- Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets  \n- Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets  \n- Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital  \n- Nonperforming loans to total gross loans  \n- Return on assets  \n- Liquid assets to short-term liabilities  \n- Net open position in foreign exchange to capital  \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nSeven FSIs are included as SDG indicators for 10.5.1 and expressed as percent. \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: This is the ratio of the core capital (Tier 1) to total (balance sheet) \nassets.   \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It is calculated using total regulatory Tier 1 capital as \nthe numerator and risk-weighted assets as the denominator. The data for this FSI are compiled in \naccordance with the guidelines of either Basel I, Basel II, or Basel III.  \n  \nNonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is calculated by taking the value of \nnonperforming loans (NPLs) less the value of specific loan loss provisions as the numerator and capital as \nthe denominator. Capital is measured as total regulatory capital.  \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is calculated by using the value of NPLs as the \nnumerator and the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and before the deduction of specific \nloan- loss provisions) as the denominator.  \n  \nReturn on assets: This FSI is calculated by dividing annualized net income before extraordinary items and \ntaxes (as recommended in the FSI Guide) by the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) \nover the same period.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: This FSI is calculated by using the core measure of liquid assets as \nthe numerator and short-term liabilities as the denominator. The ratio can also be calculated by taking \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nthe broad measure of liquid assets as the numerator. For jurisdictions that have implemented Basel III, \nthis indicator could be supplemented with the liquidity coverage ratio. \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange should be \ncalculated based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital \nshould be total regulatory capital as net open position in foreign exchange is a supervisory concept.   \n \nRationale: \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: It is a more stringent version of the leverage ratio and indicates the \nextent to which assets are funded by other than own funds and is a measure of capital adequacy of the \ndeposit-taking sector.   \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It measures the capital adequacy of deposit takers \nbased on the core capital concept of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital \nadequacy and availability ultimately determine the degree of robustness of financial institutions to \nwithstand shocks to their balance sheets.  \n  \nNonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is a capital adequacy ratio and is an important \nindicator of the capacity of bank capital to withstand losses from NPLs that are not covered by specific \nloan loss provisions.  \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is often used as a proxy for asset quality and is \nintended to identify problems with asset quality in the loan portfolio.  \n  \nReturn on assets: It is an indicator of bank profitability and is intended to measure deposit takers’ \nefficiency in using their assets.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: It is a liquid asset ratio and is intended to capture the liquidity \nmismatch of assets and liabilities and provides an indication of the extent to which deposit takers can \nmeet the short-term withdrawal of funds without facing liquidity problems.  \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: This FSI is an indicator of sensitivity to market risk, \nwhich is intended to gauge deposit takers’ exposure to exchange rate risk compared with capital. It \nmeasures the mismatch of foreign currency asset and liability positions to assess the vulnerability to \nexchange rate movements. \n \nConcepts: \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, II, or III \ndepending on countries’ supervisory practices. Denominator is total balance sheet (non-risk weighted) \nassets.  \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, \nII, or III depending on countries’ supervisory practices. Denominator is risk-weighted assets also \ncalculated based on Basel standards.  \n  \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nNonperforming loans (NPLs) net of provisions to capital: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of \nprincipal or interest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a \nloan is not going to be recovered. Only specific loan loss provisions are used in this calculation and they \nrefer charges against the value of specific loans. Data exclude accrued interest in NPLs. Capital is \nmeasured as total regulatory capital calculated based on Basel I, II, or III depending on countries’ \nsupervisory practices. \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of principal or \ninterest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a loan is not \ngoing to be recovered. The denominator is the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and \nbefore the deduction of specific loan- loss provisions).  \n  \nReturn on assets: The numerator is annualized net income before extraordinary items and taxes. The \ndenominator is the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) over the same period.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: Core measure of liquid assets includes currency and deposits and \nother financial assets available on demand or within three months. Broad measures equal core measure \nplus securities traded in liquid markets that can be converted into cash with minimal change in value. The \ndenominator is short-term elements of debt liabilities plus net (short-term) market value of financial \nderivatives position. The latter is calculated as financial derivatives liability position minus financial \nderivative asset position. Short-term refers to three months and should be defined on a remaining \nmaturity basis. If remaining maturity is not available, original maturity can be used as an alternative. \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange equals the \nforeign-currency and foreign-currency linked element of balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet \nexposures minus the foreign-currency and foreign-currency linked element of balance sheet liabilities and \noff-balance sheet exposures. Foreign-currency-linked instruments refer to accounts denominated in \nnational currency, but their payments are linked to exchange rates, thus subject to foreign exchange risk. \nThe denominator is total regulatory capital as defined above.   \n   \nComments and limitations: \n \nData for most countries are reported on a monthly or quarterly basis; a few countries report data on a \nsemi-annual basis and with a lag of more than a quarter. As of end-December 2018, there were 138 FSI \nreporters. Some countries’ compilation practices deviate from the FSI Guide methodology in certain areas \nand are documented in the FSI metadata also posted on the IMF’s FSI website. Reporting countries \nprovide all or most core FSIs and some encouraged FSIs that can be used to support the interpretation of \nthese seven SDG indicators. FSI data and metadata reported by countries are available at \nhttp://data.imf.org/FSI. \n \n \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nThe calculation of the seven FSIs is detailed in section on “Definition” above. The common source data \nare data reported by banks to supervisory authorities, which are usually the FSI compilers.   \n \nDisaggregation: \nThe FSIs disseminated by the IMF are weighted averages for the sector as a whole (e.g., deposit takers, \nother financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations). Data for parent banks, their branches, and \nrelevant subsidiaries are consolidated; if this consolidation is not possible or not applicable, an \nexplanation is provided in the metadata. There are no disaggregated breakdowns of the FSIs reported to \nthe IMF. \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\nIt is not relevant to the seven FSIs. Source data are collected by banks’ supervisory authorities and \ncomplete reporting is usually mandated by law. \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n      The FSIs are not compiled at regional or global levels. \n\n \n\nRegional aggregates: \nThe FSIs are not aggregated at regional levels. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \nData calculated by other sources could be different from the FSIs disseminated by the IMF due to the use \nof different compilation methodology and/or institutional coverage. The FSIs disseminated by the IMF are \ncompiled based on the FSI Compilation Guide, which provides the guidance on the concepts and \ndefinitions, and sources and techniques for the compilation of cross-country comparable data to support \nnational and international surveillance of financial systems. To facilitate identification of possible \ndiscrepancies across countries, reporters provide metadata to the IMF that detail departures from \nrecommendations in the FSI Guide. \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \n\n• \n\nThe FSI Compilation Guide (206) available at http://data.imf.org/FSI. \n\nQuality assurance \n\n•  The common source data are data reported by banks for supervisory purposes. National \n\nsupervisors check and validate the data that are used by national FSI compilers. IMF staff check \nthe FSIs reported by countries before posting on the FSI website and address data issues in \ncollaboration with the national compilers whenever such issues are flagged by the validation and \nconsistency checks implemented in the IMF data processing system..   \n\n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nThe common source data are data reported by banks for supervisory purposes. They include balance \nsheet, income statement, and supervisory series (such as Tier 1 capital, Tier 2 capital, risk-weighted \nassets). \nCollection process: \nThe national central banks or supervisory agencies collect these data for supervisory purposes, and these \ndata are used for FSI compilation. \nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \nAs of end-December 2018, there were 138 FSI reporters.

inequality within and among countries \nTarget 10.5: Improve the regulation and monitoring of global financial markets and institutions and \nstrengthen the implementation of such regulations \nIndicator 10.5.1: Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \nInternational Monetary Fund \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n- Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets  \n- Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets  \n- Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital  \n- Nonperforming loans to total gross loans  \n- Return on assets  \n- Liquid assets to short-term liabilities  \n- Net open position in foreign exchange to capital  \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nSeven FSIs are included as SDG indicators for 10.5.1 and expressed as percent. \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: This is the ratio of the core capital (Tier 1) to total (balance sheet) \nassets.   \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It is calculated using total regulatory Tier 1 capital as \nthe numerator and risk-weighted assets as the denominator. The data for this FSI are compiled in \naccordance with the guidelines of either Basel I, Basel II, or Basel III.  \n  \nNonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is calculated by taking the value of \nnonperforming loans (NPLs) less the value of specific loan loss provisions as the numerator and capital as \nthe denominator. Capital is measured as total regulatory capital.  \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is calculated by using the value of NPLs as the \nnumerator and the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and before the deduction of specific \nloan- loss provisions) as the denominator.  \n  \nReturn on assets: This FSI is calculated by dividing annualized net income before extraordinary items and \ntaxes (as recommended in the FSI Guide) by the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) \nover the same period.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: This FSI is calculated by using the core measure of liquid assets as \nthe numerator and short-term liabilities as the denominator. The ratio can also be calculated by taking \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nthe broad measure of liquid assets as the numerator. For jurisdictions that have implemented Basel III, \nthis indicator could be supplemented with the liquidity coverage ratio. \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange should be \ncalculated based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital \nshould be total regulatory capital as net open position in foreign exchange is a supervisory concept.   \n \nRationale: \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: It is a more stringent version of the leverage ratio and indicates the \nextent to which assets are funded by other than own funds and is a measure of capital adequacy of the \ndeposit-taking sector.   \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It measures the capital adequacy of deposit takers \nbased on the core capital concept of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital \nadequacy and availability ultimately determine the degree of robustness of financial institutions to \nwithstand shocks to their balance sheets.  \n  \nNonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is a capital adequacy ratio and is an important \nindicator of the capacity of bank capital to withstand losses from NPLs that are not covered by specific \nloan loss provisions.  \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is often used as a proxy for asset quality and is \nintended to identify problems with asset quality in the loan portfolio.  \n  \nReturn on assets: It is an indicator of bank profitability and is intended to measure deposit takers’ \nefficiency in using their assets.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: It is a liquid asset ratio and is intended to capture the liquidity \nmismatch of assets and liabilities and provides an indication of the extent to which deposit takers can \nmeet the short-term withdrawal of funds without facing liquidity problems.  \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: This FSI is an indicator of sensitivity to market risk, \nwhich is intended to gauge deposit takers’ exposure to exchange rate risk compared with capital. It \nmeasures the mismatch of foreign currency asset and liability positions to assess the vulnerability to \nexchange rate movements. \n \nConcepts: \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, II, or III \ndepending on countries’ supervisory practices. Denominator is total balance sheet (non-risk weighted) \nassets.  \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, \nII, or III depending on countries’ supervisory practices. Denominator is risk-weighted assets also \ncalculated based on Basel standards.  \n  \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nNonperforming loans (NPLs) net of provisions to capital: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of \nprincipal or interest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a \nloan is not going to be recovered. Only specific loan loss provisions are used in this calculation and they \nrefer charges against the value of specific loans. Data exclude accrued interest in NPLs. Capital is \nmeasured as total regulatory capital calculated based on Basel I, II, or III depending on countries’ \nsupervisory practices. \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of principal or \ninterest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a loan is not \ngoing to be recovered. The denominator is the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and \nbefore the deduction of specific loan- loss provisions).  \n  \nReturn on assets: The numerator is annualized net income before extraordinary items and taxes. The \ndenominator is the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) over the same period.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: Core measure of liquid assets includes currency and deposits and \nother financial assets available on demand or within three months. Broad measures equal core measure \nplus securities traded in liquid markets that can be converted into cash with minimal change in value. The \ndenominator is short-term elements of debt liabilities plus net (short-term) market value of financial \nderivatives position. The latter is calculated as financial derivatives liability position minus financial \nderivative asset position. Short-term refers to three months and should be defined on a remaining \nmaturity basis. If remaining maturity is not available, original maturity can be used as an alternative. \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange equals the \nforeign-currency and foreign-currency linked element of balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet \nexposures minus the foreign-currency and foreign-currency linked element of balance sheet liabilities and \noff-balance sheet exposures. Foreign-currency-linked instruments refer to accounts denominated in \nnational currency, but their payments are linked to exchange rates, thus subject to foreign exchange risk. \nThe denominator is total regulatory capital as defined above.   \n   \nComments and limitations: \n \nData for most countries are reported on a monthly or quarterly basis; a few countries report data on a \nsemi-annual basis and with a lag of more than a quarter. As of end-December 2018, there were 138 FSI \nreporters. Some countries’ compilation practices deviate from the FSI Guide methodology in certain areas \nand are documented in the FSI metadata also posted on the IMF’s FSI website. Reporting countries \nprovide all or most core FSIs and some encouraged FSIs that can be used to support the interpretation of \nthese seven SDG indicators. FSI data and metadata reported by countries are available at \nhttp://data.imf.org/FSI. \n \n \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nThe calculation of the seven FSIs is detailed in section on “Definition” above. The common source data \nare data reported by banks to supervisory authorities, which are usually the FSI compilers.   \n \nDisaggregation: \nThe FSIs disseminated by the IMF are weighted averages for the sector as a whole (e.g., deposit takers, \nother financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations). Data for parent banks, their branches, and \nrelevant subsidiaries are consolidated; if this consolidation is not possible or not applicable, an \nexplanation is provided in the metadata. There are no disaggregated breakdowns of the FSIs reported to \nthe IMF. \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\nIt is not relevant to the seven FSIs. Source data are collected by banks’ supervisory authorities and \ncomplete reporting is usually mandated by law. \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n      The FSIs are not compiled at regional or global levels. \n\n \n\nRegional aggregates: \nThe FSIs are not aggregated at regional levels. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \nData calculated by other sources could be different from the FSIs disseminated by the IMF due to the use \nof different compilation methodology and/or institutional coverage. The FSIs disseminated by the IMF are \ncompiled based on the FSI Compilation Guide, which provides the guidance on the concepts and \ndefinitions, and sources and techniques for the compilation of cross-country comparable data to support \nnational and international surveillance of financial systems. To facilitate identification of possible \ndiscrepancies across countries, reporters provide metadata to the IMF that detail departures from \nrecommendations in the FSI Guide. \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \n\n• \n\nThe FSI Compilation Guide (206) available at http://data.imf.org/FSI. \n\nQuality assurance \n\n•  The common source data are data reported by banks for supervisory purposes. National \n\nsupervisors check and validate the data that are used by national FSI compilers. IMF staff check \nthe FSIs reported by countries before posting on the FSI website and address data issues in \ncollaboration with the national compilers whenever such issues are flagged by the validation and \nconsistency checks implemented in the IMF data processing system..   \n\n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nThe common source data are data reported by banks for supervisory purposes. They include balance \nsheet, income statement, and supervisory series (such as Tier 1 capital, Tier 2 capital, risk-weighted \nassets). \nCollection process: \nThe national central banks or supervisory agencies collect these data for supervisory purposes, and these \ndata are used for FSI compilation. \nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \nAs of end-December 2018, there were 138 FSI reporters.  All countries report all or most core FSIs and \nsome encouraged FSIs that can be used to support the interpretation of these seven SDG indicators.  \n \nTime series: \nData for most countries are reported on a monthly or quarterly basis; a few countries report data on a \nsemi-annual basis and with a lag of more than a quarter. Data are available as far back as 2005 for some \ncountries. \n \nCalendar \n\n \nData collection: \nThere are no predetermined deadlines. Countries report new FSIs as soon as they are ready \n \nData release: \nData are disseminated on the IMF website as soon as they are ready. \nData providers \n\nThe national central banks or bank supervisory agencies. \n \nData compilers \n\nThe FSIs are compiled at national level, but not at region or global level.  \nReferences \n\nURL: http://data.imf.org/FSI \n \nReferences:  \n \nRelated indicators \n\nLinkages with any other Goals and Targets: Recommendation II.2 of G-20 Data Gap Initiative – 2 concerns \nFSIs.

and among countries \nTarget 10.5: Improve the regulation and monitoring of global financial markets and institutions and \nstrengthen the implementation of such regulations \nIndicator 10.5.1: Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \nInternational Monetary Fund \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n- Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets  \n- Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets  \n- Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital  \n- Nonperforming loans to total gross loans  \n- Return on assets  \n- Liquid assets to short-term liabilities  \n- Net open position in foreign exchange to capital  \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nSeven FSIs are included as SDG indicators for 10.5.1 and expressed as percent. \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: This is the ratio of the core capital (Tier 1) to total (balance sheet) \nassets.   \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It is calculated using total regulatory Tier 1 capital as \nthe numerator and risk-weighted assets as the denominator. The data for this FSI are compiled in \naccordance with the guidelines of either Basel I, Basel II, or Basel III.  \n  \nNonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is calculated by taking the value of \nnonperforming loans (NPLs) less the value of specific loan loss provisions as the numerator and capital as \nthe denominator. Capital is measured as total regulatory capital.  \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is calculated by using the value of NPLs as the \nnumerator and the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and before the deduction of specific \nloan- loss provisions) as the denominator.  \n  \nReturn on assets: This FSI is calculated by dividing annualized net income before extraordinary items and \ntaxes (as recommended in the FSI Guide) by the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) \nover the same period.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: This FSI is calculated by using the core measure of liquid assets as \nthe numerator and short-term liabilities as the denominator. The ratio can also be calculated by taking \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nthe broad measure of liquid assets as the numerator. For jurisdictions that have implemented Basel III, \nthis indicator could be supplemented with the liquidity coverage ratio. \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange should be \ncalculated based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital \nshould be total regulatory capital as net open position in foreign exchange is a supervisory concept.   \n \nRationale: \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: It is a more stringent version of the leverage ratio and indicates the \nextent to which assets are funded by other than own funds and is a measure of capital adequacy of the \ndeposit-taking sector.   \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It measures the capital adequacy of deposit takers \nbased on the core capital concept of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital \nadequacy and availability ultimately determine the degree of robustness of financial institutions to \nwithstand shocks to their balance sheets.  \n  \nNonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is a capital adequacy ratio and is an important \nindicator of the capacity of bank capital to withstand losses from NPLs that are not covered by specific \nloan loss provisions.  \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is often used as a proxy for asset quality and is \nintended to identify problems with asset quality in the loan portfolio.  \n  \nReturn on assets: It is an indicator of bank profitability and is intended to measure deposit takers’ \nefficiency in using their assets.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: It is a liquid asset ratio and is intended to capture the liquidity \nmismatch of assets and liabilities and provides an indication of the extent to which deposit takers can \nmeet the short-term withdrawal of funds without facing liquidity problems.  \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: This FSI is an indicator of sensitivity to market risk, \nwhich is intended to gauge deposit takers’ exposure to exchange rate risk compared with capital. It \nmeasures the mismatch of foreign currency asset and liability positions to assess the vulnerability to \nexchange rate movements. \n \nConcepts: \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, II, or III \ndepending on countries’ supervisory practices. Denominator is total balance sheet (non-risk weighted) \nassets.  \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, \nII, or III depending on countries’ supervisory practices. Denominator is risk-weighted assets also \ncalculated based on Basel standards.  \n  \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nNonperforming loans (NPLs) net of provisions to capital: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of \nprincipal or interest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a \nloan is not going to be recovered. Only specific loan loss provisions are used in this calculation and they \nrefer charges against the value of specific loans. Data exclude accrued interest in NPLs. Capital is \nmeasured as total regulatory capital calculated based on Basel I, II, or III depending on countries’ \nsupervisory practices. \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of principal or \ninterest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a loan is not \ngoing to be recovered. The denominator is the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and \nbefore the deduction of specific loan- loss provisions).  \n  \nReturn on assets: The numerator is annualized net income before extraordinary items and taxes. The \ndenominator is the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) over the same period.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: Core measure of liquid assets includes currency and deposits and \nother financial assets available on demand or within three months. Broad measures equal core measure \nplus securities traded in liquid markets that can be converted into cash with minimal change in value. The \ndenominator is short-term elements of debt liabilities plus net (short-term) market value of financial \nderivatives position. The latter is calculated as financial derivatives liability position minus financial \nderivative asset position. Short-term refers to three months and should be defined on a remaining \nmaturity basis. If remaining maturity is not available, original maturity can be used as an alternative. \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange equals the \nforeign-currency and foreign-currency linked element of balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet \nexposures minus the foreign-currency and foreign-currency linked element of balance sheet liabilities and \noff-balance sheet exposures. Foreign-currency-linked instruments refer to accounts denominated in \nnational currency, but their payments are linked to exchange rates, thus subject to foreign exchange risk. \nThe denominator is total regulatory capital as defined above.   \n   \nComments and limitations: \n \nData for most countries are reported on a monthly or quarterly basis; a few countries report data on a \nsemi-annual basis and with a lag of more than a quarter. As of end-December 2018, there were 138 FSI \nreporters. Some countries’ compilation practices deviate from the FSI Guide methodology in certain areas \nand are documented in the FSI metadata also posted on the IMF’s FSI website. Reporting countries \nprovide all or most core FSIs and some encouraged FSIs that can be used to support the interpretation of \nthese seven SDG indicators. FSI data and metadata reported by countries are available at \nhttp://data.imf.org/FSI. \n \n \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nThe calculation of the seven FSIs is detailed in section on “Definition” above. The common source data \nare data reported by banks to supervisory authorities, which are usually the FSI compilers.   \n \nDisaggregation: \nThe FSIs disseminated by the IMF are weighted averages for the sector as a whole (e.g., deposit takers, \nother financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations). Data for parent banks, their branches, and \nrelevant subsidiaries are consolidated; if this consolidation is not possible or not applicable, an \nexplanation is provided in the metadata. There are no disaggregated breakdowns of the FSIs reported to \nthe IMF. \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\nIt is not relevant to the seven FSIs. Source data are collected by banks’ supervisory authorities and \ncomplete reporting is usually mandated by law. \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n      The FSIs are not compiled at regional or global levels. \n\n \n\nRegional aggregates: \nThe FSIs are not aggregated at regional levels. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \nData calculated by other sources could be different from the FSIs disseminated by the IMF due to the use \nof different compilation methodology and/or institutional coverage. The FSIs disseminated by the IMF are \ncompiled based on the FSI Compilation Guide, which provides the guidance on the concepts and \ndefinitions, and sources and techniques for the compilation of cross-country comparable data to support \nnational and international surveillance of financial systems. To facilitate identification of possible \ndiscrepancies across countries, reporters provide metadata to the IMF that detail departures from \nrecommendations in the FSI Guide. \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \n\n• \n\nThe FSI Compilation Guide (206) available at http://data.imf.org/FSI. \n\nQuality assurance \n\n•  The common source data are data reported by banks for supervisory purposes. National \n\nsupervisors check and validate the data that are used by national FSI compilers. IMF staff check \nthe FSIs reported by countries before posting on the FSI website and address data issues in \ncollaboration with the national compilers whenever such issues are flagged by the validation and \nconsistency checks implemented in the IMF data processing system..   \n\n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nThe common source data are data reported by banks for supervisory purposes.

\n5 \n6 \n7 \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: This is the ratio of the core capital (Tier 1) to total (balance sheet) \nassets.   \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It is calculated using total regulatory Tier 1 capital as \nthe numerator and risk-weighted assets as the denominator. The data for this FSI are compiled in \naccordance with the guidelines of either Basel I, Basel II, or Basel III.  \n  \nNonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is calculated by taking the value of \nnonperforming loans (NPLs) less the value of specific loan loss provisions as the numerator and capital as \nthe denominator. Capital is measured as total regulatory capital.  \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is calculated by using the value of NPLs as the \nnumerator and the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and before the deduction of specific \nloan- loss provisions) as the denominator.  \n  \nReturn on assets: This FSI is calculated by dividing annualized net income before extraordinary items and \ntaxes (as recommended in the FSI Guide) by the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) \nover the same period.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: This FSI is calculated by using the core measure of liquid assets as \nthe numerator and short-term liabilities as the denominator. The ratio can also be calculated by taking \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nthe broad measure of liquid assets as the numerator. For jurisdictions that have implemented Basel III, \nthis indicator could be supplemented with the liquidity coverage ratio. \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange should be \ncalculated based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital \nshould be total regulatory capital as net open position in foreign exchange is a supervisory concept.   \n \nRationale: \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: It is a more stringent version of the leverage ratio and indicates the \nextent to which assets are funded by other than own funds and is a measure of capital adequacy of the \ndeposit-taking sector.   \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It measures the capital adequacy of deposit takers \nbased on the core capital concept of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital \nadequacy and availability ultimately determine the degree of robustness of financial institutions to \nwithstand shocks to their balance sheets.  \n  \nNonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is a capital adequacy ratio and is an important \nindicator of the capacity of bank capital to withstand losses from NPLs that are not covered by specific \nloan loss provisions.  \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is often used as a proxy for asset quality and is \nintended to identify problems with asset quality in the loan portfolio.  \n  \nReturn on assets: It is an indicator of bank profitability and is intended to measure deposit takers’ \nefficiency in using their assets.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: It is a liquid asset ratio and is intended to capture the liquidity \nmismatch of assets and liabilities and provides an indication of the extent to which deposit takers can \nmeet the short-term withdrawal of funds without facing liquidity problems.  \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: This FSI is an indicator of sensitivity to market risk, \nwhich is intended to gauge deposit takers’ exposure to exchange rate risk compared with capital. It \nmeasures the mismatch of foreign currency asset and liability positions to assess the vulnerability to \nexchange rate movements. \n \nConcepts: \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, II, or III \ndepending on countries’ supervisory practices. Denominator is total balance sheet (non-risk weighted) \nassets.  \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, \nII, or III depending on countries’ supervisory practices. Denominator is risk-weighted assets also \ncalculated based on Basel standards.  \n  \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nNonperforming loans (NPLs) net of provisions to capital: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of \nprincipal or interest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a \nloan is not going to be recovered. Only specific loan loss provisions are used in this calculation and they \nrefer charges against the value of specific loans. Data exclude accrued interest in NPLs. Capital is \nmeasured as total regulatory capital calculated based on Basel I, II, or III depending on countries’ \nsupervisory practices. \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of principal or \ninterest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a loan is not \ngoing to be recovered. The denominator is the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and \nbefore the deduction of specific loan- loss provisions).  \n  \nReturn on assets: The numerator is annualized net income before extraordinary items and taxes. The \ndenominator is the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) over the same period.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: Core measure of liquid assets includes currency and deposits and \nother financial assets available on demand or within three months. Broad measures equal core measure \nplus securities traded in liquid markets that can be converted into cash with minimal change in value. The \ndenominator is short-term elements of debt liabilities plus net (short-term) market value of financial \nderivatives position. The latter is calculated as financial derivatives liability position minus financial \nderivative asset position. Short-term refers to three months and should be defined on a remaining \nmaturity basis. If remaining maturity is not available, original maturity can be used as an alternative. \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange equals the \nforeign-currency and foreign-currency linked element of balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet \nexposures minus the foreign-currency and foreign-currency linked element of balance sheet liabilities and \noff-balance sheet exposures. Foreign-currency-linked instruments refer to accounts denominated in \nnational currency, but their payments are linked to exchange rates, thus subject to foreign exchange risk. \nThe denominator is total regulatory capital as defined above.   \n   \nComments and limitations: \n \nData for most countries are reported on a monthly or quarterly basis; a few countries report data on a \nsemi-annual basis and with a lag of more than a quarter. As of end-December 2018, there were 138 FSI \nreporters. Some countries’ compilation practices deviate from the FSI Guide methodology in certain areas \nand are documented in the FSI metadata also posted on the IMF’s FSI website. Reporting countries \nprovide all or most core FSIs and some encouraged FSIs that can be used to support the interpretation of \nthese seven SDG indicators. FSI data and metadata reported by countries are available at \nhttp://data.imf.org/FSI. \n \n \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nThe calculation of the seven FSIs is detailed in section on “Definition” above. The common source data \nare data reported by banks to supervisory authorities, which are usually the FSI compilers.   \n \nDisaggregation: \nThe FSIs disseminated by the IMF are weighted averages for the sector as a whole (e.g., deposit takers, \nother financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations). Data for parent banks, their branches, and \nrelevant subsidiaries are consolidated; if this consolidation is not possible or not applicable, an \nexplanation is provided in the metadata. There are no disaggregated breakdowns of the FSIs reported to \nthe IMF. \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\nIt is not relevant to the seven FSIs. Source data are collected by banks’ supervisory authorities and \ncomplete reporting is usually mandated by law. \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n      The FSIs are not compiled at regional or global levels. \n\n \n\nRegional aggregates: \nThe FSIs are not aggregated at regional levels. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \nData calculated by other sources could be different from the FSIs disseminated by the IMF due to the use \nof different compilation methodology and/or institutional coverage. The FSIs disseminated by the IMF are \ncompiled based on the FSI Compilation Guide, which provides the guidance on the concepts and \ndefinitions, and sources and techniques for the compilation of cross-country comparable data to support \nnational and international surveillance of financial systems. To facilitate identification of possible \ndiscrepancies across countries, reporters provide metadata to the IMF that detail departures from \nrecommendations in the FSI Guide. \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \n\n• \n\nThe FSI Compilation Guide (206) available at http://data.imf.org/FSI. \n\nQuality assurance \n\n•  The common source data are data reported by banks for supervisory purposes. National \n\nsupervisors check and validate the data that are used by national FSI compilers. IMF staff check \nthe FSIs reported by countries before posting on the FSI website and address data issues in \ncollaboration with the national compilers whenever such issues are flagged by the validation and \nconsistency checks implemented in the IMF data processing system..   \n\n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nThe common source data are data reported by banks for supervisory purposes.

03 December 2018 \n\nGoal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries \nTarget 10.5: Improve the regulation and monitoring of global financial markets and institutions and \nstrengthen the implementation of such regulations \nIndicator 10.5.1: Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \nInternational Monetary Fund \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n- Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets  \n- Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets  \n- Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital  \n- Nonperforming loans to total gross loans  \n- Return on assets  \n- Liquid assets to short-term liabilities  \n- Net open position in foreign exchange to capital  \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nSeven FSIs are included as SDG indicators for 10.5.1 and expressed as percent. \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: This is the ratio of the core capital (Tier 1) to total (balance sheet) \nassets.   \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It is calculated using total regulatory Tier 1 capital as \nthe numerator and risk-weighted assets as the denominator. The data for this FSI are compiled in \naccordance with the guidelines of either Basel I, Basel II, or Basel III.  \n  \nNonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is calculated by taking the value of \nnonperforming loans (NPLs) less the value of specific loan loss provisions as the numerator and capital as \nthe denominator. Capital is measured as total regulatory capital.  \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is calculated by using the value of NPLs as the \nnumerator and the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and before the deduction of specific \nloan- loss provisions) as the denominator.  \n  \nReturn on assets: This FSI is calculated by dividing annualized net income before extraordinary items and \ntaxes (as recommended in the FSI Guide) by the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) \nover the same period.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: This FSI is calculated by using the core measure of liquid assets as \nthe numerator and short-term liabilities as the denominator. The ratio can also be calculated by taking \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nthe broad measure of liquid assets as the numerator. For jurisdictions that have implemented Basel III, \nthis indicator could be supplemented with the liquidity coverage ratio. \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange should be \ncalculated based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital \nshould be total regulatory capital as net open position in foreign exchange is a supervisory concept.   \n \nRationale: \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: It is a more stringent version of the leverage ratio and indicates the \nextent to which assets are funded by other than own funds and is a measure of capital adequacy of the \ndeposit-taking sector.   \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It measures the capital adequacy of deposit takers \nbased on the core capital concept of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital \nadequacy and availability ultimately determine the degree of robustness of financial institutions to \nwithstand shocks to their balance sheets.  \n  \nNonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is a capital adequacy ratio and is an important \nindicator of the capacity of bank capital to withstand losses from NPLs that are not covered by specific \nloan loss provisions.  \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is often used as a proxy for asset quality and is \nintended to identify problems with asset quality in the loan portfolio.  \n  \nReturn on assets: It is an indicator of bank profitability and is intended to measure deposit takers’ \nefficiency in using their assets.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: It is a liquid asset ratio and is intended to capture the liquidity \nmismatch of assets and liabilities and provides an indication of the extent to which deposit takers can \nmeet the short-term withdrawal of funds without facing liquidity problems.  \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: This FSI is an indicator of sensitivity to market risk, \nwhich is intended to gauge deposit takers’ exposure to exchange rate risk compared with capital. It \nmeasures the mismatch of foreign currency asset and liability positions to assess the vulnerability to \nexchange rate movements. \n \nConcepts: \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, II, or III \ndepending on countries’ supervisory practices. Denominator is total balance sheet (non-risk weighted) \nassets.  \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, \nII, or III depending on countries’ supervisory practices. Denominator is risk-weighted assets also \ncalculated based on Basel standards.  \n  \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nNonperforming loans (NPLs) net of provisions to capital: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of \nprincipal or interest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a \nloan is not going to be recovered. Only specific loan loss provisions are used in this calculation and they \nrefer charges against the value of specific loans. Data exclude accrued interest in NPLs. Capital is \nmeasured as total regulatory capital calculated based on Basel I, II, or III depending on countries’ \nsupervisory practices. \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of principal or \ninterest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a loan is not \ngoing to be recovered. The denominator is the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and \nbefore the deduction of specific loan- loss provisions).  \n  \nReturn on assets: The numerator is annualized net income before extraordinary items and taxes. The \ndenominator is the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) over the same period.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: Core measure of liquid assets includes currency and deposits and \nother financial assets available on demand or within three months. Broad measures equal core measure \nplus securities traded in liquid markets that can be converted into cash with minimal change in value. The \ndenominator is short-term elements of debt liabilities plus net (short-term) market value of financial \nderivatives position. The latter is calculated as financial derivatives liability position minus financial \nderivative asset position. Short-term refers to three months and should be defined on a remaining \nmaturity basis. If remaining maturity is not available, original maturity can be used as an alternative. \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange equals the \nforeign-currency and foreign-currency linked element of balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet \nexposures minus the foreign-currency and foreign-currency linked element of balance sheet liabilities and \noff-balance sheet exposures. Foreign-currency-linked instruments refer to accounts denominated in \nnational currency, but their payments are linked to exchange rates, thus subject to foreign exchange risk. \nThe denominator is total regulatory capital as defined above.   \n   \nComments and limitations: \n \nData for most countries are reported on a monthly or quarterly basis; a few countries report data on a \nsemi-annual basis and with a lag of more than a quarter. As of end-December 2018, there were 138 FSI \nreporters. Some countries’ compilation practices deviate from the FSI Guide methodology in certain areas \nand are documented in the FSI metadata also posted on the IMF’s FSI website. Reporting countries \nprovide all or most core FSIs and some encouraged FSIs that can be used to support the interpretation of \nthese seven SDG indicators. FSI data and metadata reported by countries are available at \nhttp://data.imf.org/FSI. \n \n \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nThe calculation of the seven FSIs is detailed in section on “Definition” above. The common source data \nare data reported by banks to supervisory authorities, which are usually the FSI compilers.   \n \nDisaggregation: \nThe FSIs disseminated by the IMF are weighted averages for the sector as a whole (e.g., deposit takers, \nother financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations). Data for parent banks, their branches, and \nrelevant subsidiaries are consolidated; if this consolidation is not possible or not applicable, an \nexplanation is provided in the metadata. There are no disaggregated breakdowns of the FSIs reported to \nthe IMF. \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\nIt is not relevant to the seven FSIs. Source data are collected by banks’ supervisory authorities and \ncomplete reporting is usually mandated by law. \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n      The FSIs are not compiled at regional or global levels. \n\n \n\nRegional aggregates: \nThe FSIs are not aggregated at regional levels. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \nData calculated by other sources could be different from the FSIs disseminated by the IMF due to the use \nof different compilation methodology and/or institutional coverage. The FSIs disseminated by the IMF are \ncompiled based on the FSI Compilation Guide, which provides the guidance on the concepts and \ndefinitions, and sources and techniques for the compilation of cross-country comparable data to support \nnational and international surveillance of financial systems. To facilitate identification of possible \ndiscrepancies across countries, reporters provide metadata to the IMF that detail departures from \nrecommendations in the FSI Guide. \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \n\n• \n\nThe FSI Compilation Guide (206) available at http://data.imf.org/FSI. \n\nQuality assurance \n\n•  The common source data are data reported by banks for supervisory purposes. National \n\nsupervisors check and validate the data that are used by national FSI compilers. IMF staff check \nthe FSIs reported by countries before posting on the FSI website and address data issues in \ncollaboration with the national compilers whenever such issues are flagged by the validation and \nconsistency checks implemented in the IMF data processing system..   \n\n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nThe common source data are data reported by banks for supervisory purposes. They include balance \nsheet, income statement, and supervisory series (such as Tier 1 capital, Tier 2 capital, risk-weighted \nassets). \nCollection process: \nThe national central banks or supervisory agencies collect these data for supervisory purposes, and these \ndata are used for FSI compilation. \nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \nAs of end-December 2018, there were 138 FSI reporters.  All countries report all or most core FSIs and \nsome encouraged FSIs that can be used to support the interpretation of these seven SDG indicators.  \n \nTime series: \nData for most countries are reported on a monthly or quarterly basis; a few countries report data on a \nsemi-annual basis and with a lag of more than a quarter. Data are available as far back as 2005 for some \ncountries. \n \nCalendar \n\n \nData collection: \nThere are no predetermined deadlines. Countries report new FSIs as soon as they are ready \n \nData release: \nData are disseminated on the IMF website as soon as they are ready. \nData providers \n\nThe national central banks or bank supervisory agencies. \n \nData compilers \n\nThe FSIs are compiled at national level, but not at region or global level.  \nReferences \n\nURL: http://data.imf.org/FSI \n \nReferences:  \n \nRelated indicators \n\nLinkages with any other Goals and Targets: Recommendation II.2 of G-20 Data Gap Initiative – 2 concerns \nFSIs.

and among countries \nTarget 10.5: Improve the regulation and monitoring of global financial markets and institutions and \nstrengthen the implementation of such regulations \nIndicator 10.5.1: Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \nInternational Monetary Fund \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n- Regulatory Tier 1 capital to assets  \n- Regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets  \n- Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital  \n- Nonperforming loans to total gross loans  \n- Return on assets  \n- Liquid assets to short-term liabilities  \n- Net open position in foreign exchange to capital  \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nSeven FSIs are included as SDG indicators for 10.5.1 and expressed as percent. \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: This is the ratio of the core capital (Tier 1) to total (balance sheet) \nassets.   \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It is calculated using total regulatory Tier 1 capital as \nthe numerator and risk-weighted assets as the denominator. The data for this FSI are compiled in \naccordance with the guidelines of either Basel I, Basel II, or Basel III.  \n  \nNonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is calculated by taking the value of \nnonperforming loans (NPLs) less the value of specific loan loss provisions as the numerator and capital as \nthe denominator. Capital is measured as total regulatory capital.  \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is calculated by using the value of NPLs as the \nnumerator and the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and before the deduction of specific \nloan- loss provisions) as the denominator.  \n  \nReturn on assets: This FSI is calculated by dividing annualized net income before extraordinary items and \ntaxes (as recommended in the FSI Guide) by the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) \nover the same period.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: This FSI is calculated by using the core measure of liquid assets as \nthe numerator and short-term liabilities as the denominator. The ratio can also be calculated by taking \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nthe broad measure of liquid assets as the numerator. For jurisdictions that have implemented Basel III, \nthis indicator could be supplemented with the liquidity coverage ratio. \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange should be \ncalculated based on the recommendation of the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital \nshould be total regulatory capital as net open position in foreign exchange is a supervisory concept.   \n \nRationale: \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: It is a more stringent version of the leverage ratio and indicates the \nextent to which assets are funded by other than own funds and is a measure of capital adequacy of the \ndeposit-taking sector.   \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: It measures the capital adequacy of deposit takers \nbased on the core capital concept of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). Capital \nadequacy and availability ultimately determine the degree of robustness of financial institutions to \nwithstand shocks to their balance sheets.  \n  \nNonperforming loans net of provisions to capital: This FSI is a capital adequacy ratio and is an important \nindicator of the capacity of bank capital to withstand losses from NPLs that are not covered by specific \nloan loss provisions.  \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: This FSI is often used as a proxy for asset quality and is \nintended to identify problems with asset quality in the loan portfolio.  \n  \nReturn on assets: It is an indicator of bank profitability and is intended to measure deposit takers’ \nefficiency in using their assets.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: It is a liquid asset ratio and is intended to capture the liquidity \nmismatch of assets and liabilities and provides an indication of the extent to which deposit takers can \nmeet the short-term withdrawal of funds without facing liquidity problems.  \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: This FSI is an indicator of sensitivity to market risk, \nwhich is intended to gauge deposit takers’ exposure to exchange rate risk compared with capital. It \nmeasures the mismatch of foreign currency asset and liability positions to assess the vulnerability to \nexchange rate movements. \n \nConcepts: \n \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to assets: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, II, or III \ndepending on countries’ supervisory practices. Denominator is total balance sheet (non-risk weighted) \nassets.  \n  \nRegulatory Tier 1 capital to risk- weighted assets: Regulatory Tier 1 capital is calculated based on Basel I, \nII, or III depending on countries’ supervisory practices. Denominator is risk-weighted assets also \ncalculated based on Basel standards.  \n  \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nNonperforming loans (NPLs) net of provisions to capital: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of \nprincipal or interest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a \nloan is not going to be recovered. Only specific loan loss provisions are used in this calculation and they \nrefer charges against the value of specific loans. Data exclude accrued interest in NPLs. Capital is \nmeasured as total regulatory capital calculated based on Basel I, II, or III depending on countries’ \nsupervisory practices. \n  \nNonperforming loans to total gross loans: A loan is classified as NPL when payment of principal or \ninterest is past due by 90 days or more, or evidence exists that a full or partial amount of a loan is not \ngoing to be recovered. The denominator is the total value of the loan portfolio (including NPLs, and \nbefore the deduction of specific loan- loss provisions).  \n  \nReturn on assets: The numerator is annualized net income before extraordinary items and taxes. The \ndenominator is the average value of total assets (financial and nonfinancial) over the same period.  \n  \nLiquid assets to short-term liabilities: Core measure of liquid assets includes currency and deposits and \nother financial assets available on demand or within three months. Broad measures equal core measure \nplus securities traded in liquid markets that can be converted into cash with minimal change in value. The \ndenominator is short-term elements of debt liabilities plus net (short-term) market value of financial \nderivatives position. The latter is calculated as financial derivatives liability position minus financial \nderivative asset position. Short-term refers to three months and should be defined on a remaining \nmaturity basis. If remaining maturity is not available, original maturity can be used as an alternative. \n  \nNet open position in foreign exchange to capital: The net open position in foreign exchange equals the \nforeign-currency and foreign-currency linked element of balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet \nexposures minus the foreign-currency and foreign-currency linked element of balance sheet liabilities and \noff-balance sheet exposures. Foreign-currency-linked instruments refer to accounts denominated in \nnational currency, but their payments are linked to exchange rates, thus subject to foreign exchange risk. \nThe denominator is total regulatory capital as defined above.   \n   \nComments and limitations: \n \nData for most countries are reported on a monthly or quarterly basis; a few countries report data on a \nsemi-annual basis and with a lag of more than a quarter. As of end-December 2018, there were 138 FSI \nreporters. Some countries’ compilation practices deviate from the FSI Guide methodology in certain areas \nand are documented in the FSI metadata also posted on the IMF’s FSI website. Reporting countries \nprovide all or most core FSIs and some encouraged FSIs that can be used to support the interpretation of \nthese seven SDG indicators. FSI data and metadata reported by countries are available at \nhttp://data.imf.org/FSI. \n \n \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nThe calculation of the seven FSIs is detailed in section on “Definition” above. The common source data \nare data reported by banks to supervisory authorities, which are usually the FSI compilers.   \n \nDisaggregation: \nThe FSIs disseminated by the IMF are weighted averages for the sector as a whole (e.g., deposit takers, \nother financial corporations, nonfinancial corporations). Data for parent banks, their branches, and \nrelevant subsidiaries are consolidated; if this consolidation is not possible or not applicable, an \nexplanation is provided in the metadata. There are no disaggregated breakdowns of the FSIs reported to \nthe IMF. \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\nIt is not relevant to the seven FSIs. Source data are collected by banks’ supervisory authorities and \ncomplete reporting is usually mandated by law. \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n      The FSIs are not compiled at regional or global levels. \n\n \n\nRegional aggregates: \nThe FSIs are not aggregated at regional levels. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \nData calculated by other sources could be different from the FSIs disseminated by the IMF due to the use \nof different compilation methodology and/or institutional coverage. The FSIs disseminated by the IMF are \ncompiled based on the FSI Compilation Guide, which provides the guidance on the concepts and \ndefinitions, and sources and techniques for the compilation of cross-country comparable data to support \nnational and international surveillance of financial systems. To facilitate identification of possible \ndiscrepancies across countries, reporters provide metadata to the IMF that detail departures from \nrecommendations in the FSI Guide. \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \n\n• \n\nThe FSI Compilation Guide (206) available at http://data.imf.org/FSI. \n\nQuality assurance \n\n•  The common source data are data reported by banks for supervisory purposes. National \n\nsupervisors check and validate the data that are used by national FSI compilers. IMF staff check \nthe FSIs reported by countries before posting on the FSI website and address data issues in \ncollaboration with the national compilers whenever such issues are flagged by the validation and \nconsistency checks implemented in the IMF data processing system..   \n\n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n\n\fLast updated: 03 December 2018 \n\nThe common source data are data reported by banks for supervisory purposes. They include balance \nsheet, income statement, and supervisory series (such as Tier 1 capital, Tier 2 capital, risk-weighted \nassets). \nCollection process: \nThe national central banks or supervisory agencies collect these data for supervisory purposes, and these \ndata are used for FSI compilation. \nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \nAs of end-December 2018, there were 138 FSI reporters.
