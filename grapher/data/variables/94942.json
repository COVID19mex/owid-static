Appropriate care of the sick child is defined as providers that can correctly diagnose and treat pneumonia. The proportion of under-fives with ARI that are taken to an appropriate health-care provider is therefore a key indicator for coverage of intervention and care-seeking, and provides critical inputs to the monitoring of progress towards child survival-related Sustainable Development Goals and related strategies.\n\nDefinition\nPercentage of children under 5 years of age with symptoms of pneumonia (cough and difficult breathing NOT due to a problem in the chest and a blocked nose) in the two weeks preceding the survey taken to an appropriate health facility or provider.\n\nAssociated terms\n\n    \n\nPreferred data sources\nHousehold surveys\n\nOther possible data sources\nFacility reporting system\n\nMethod of measurement\nMothers or caregivers of children under five years of age are asked if the child had symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI),  and if so, whether treatment was sought and where it was sought.   During the UNICEF/WHO Meeting on Child Survival Survey-based Indicators, held in New York, USA, on 17–18 June 2004, it was recommended that suspected ARI be described as “presumed pneumonia” to better reflect the probable cause and the recommended interventions. The definition of ARI used in the DHS and MICS was chosen by the group and is based on the mother’s perceptions of a child who has a cough, is breathing faster than usual with short, quick breaths or is having difficulty breathing, excluding children who had only a blocked nose.\n\nMethod of estimation\nData are taken from UNICEF database (see link below), which compiled data from household surveys such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS).\n\nM&E Framework\nOutput\n\nMethod of estimation of global and regional aggregates\nPopulation-weighted average.\n\nDisaggregation\nLocation (urban/rural)\n\nDisaggregation\nEducation level : Maternal education\n\nDisaggregation\nWealth : Wealth quintile\n\nDisaggregation\nSex\n\nUnit of Measure\nN/A\n\nUnit Multiplier\nNot Applicable\n\nExpected frequency of data dissemination\nAnnual\n\nExpected frequency of data collection\nEvery 3-5 years\n\nLimitations\nThis indicator is usually collected in DHS and MICS surveys; however, the accuracy of reporting in household surveys varies and is likely to be prone to recall bias. Seasonality related to the prevalence of ARI may also affect the results and their comparability between and within countries.\n\nLinks\nUnicef data: pneumonia\n\nLinks\nCare Seeking Behaviour for Children with Suspected Pneumonia in Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with High Pneumonia Mortality (Noordam et al, PLOS Med, 2015)\n\nComments\nThe framework for the review of child survival indicators during the UNICEF/WHO Meeting on Child Survival Survey-based Indicators was the set of prevention and treatment interventions outlined in the Lancet series on child survival.\n\nContact Person\n\n      \n\n"}}},"entityKey":{"17":{"name":"Algeria","code":"DZA"},"22":{"name":"Armenia","code":"ARM"},"25":{"name":"Azerbaijan","code":"AZE"},"28":{"name":"Bangladesh","code":"BGD"},"30":{"name":"Belarus","code":"BLR"},"31":{"name":"Belize","code":"BLZ"},"32":{"name":"Benin","code":"BEN"},"33":{"name":"Bhutan","code":"BTN"},"34":{"name":"Bolivia","code":"BOL"},"35":{"name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","code":"BIH"},"37":{"name":"Brazil","code":"BRA"},"40":{"name":"Burkina Faso","code":"BFA"},"41":{"name":"Burundi","code":"BDI"},"42":{"name":"Cambodia","code":"KHM"},"43":{"name":"Cameroon","code":"CMR"},"45":{"name":"Cape Verde","code":"CPV"},"60":{"name":"Zambia","code":"ZMB"},"61":{"name":"Yemen","code":"YEM"},"62":{"name":"Uzbekistan","code":"UZB"},"64":{"name":"Tanzania","code":"TZA"},"65":{"name":"Egypt","code":"EGY"},"67":{"name":"Ukraine","code":"UKR"},"68":{"name":"Uganda","code":"UGA"},"71":{"name":"Tunisia","code":"TUN"},"74":{"name":"Togo","code":"TGO"},"75":{"name":"Thailand","code":"THA"},"76":{"name":"Tajikistan","code":"TJK"},"77":{"name":"Syria","code":"SYR"},"78":{"name":"Swaziland","code":"SWZ"},"80":{"name":"Zimbabwe","code":"ZWE"},"82":{"name":"Somalia","code":"SOM"},"84":{"name":"Vietnam","code":"VNM"},"87":{"name":"Sierra Leone","code":"SLE"},"88":{"name":"Serbia","code":"SRB"},"89":{"name":"Senegal","code":"SEN"},"91":{"name":"Rwanda","code":"RWA"},"94":{"name":"Guinea-Bissau","code":"GNB"},"96":{"name":"Philippines","code":"PHL"},"97":{"name":"Peru","code":"PER"},"98":{"name":"Paraguay","code":"PRY"},"103":{"name":"Nigeria","code":"NGA"},"104":{"name":"Niger","code":"NER"},"105":{"name":"Nicaragua","code":"NIC"},"107":{"name":"Nepal","code":"NPL"},"108":{"name":"Namibia","code":"NAM"},"109":{"name":"Mozambique","code":"MOZ"},"111":{"name":"Moldova","code":"MDA"},"112":{"name":"Mongolia","code":"MNG"},"114":{"name":"Mauritania","code":"MRT"},"115":{"name":"Mali","code":"MLI"},"117":{"name":"Malawi","code":"MWI"},"121":{"name":"Liberia","code":"LBR"},"123":{"name":"Lesotho","code":"LSO"},"125":{"name":"Laos","code":"LAO"},"126":{"name":"Kyrgyzstan","code":"KGZ"},"127":{"name":"South Korea","code":"KOR"},"128":{"name":"North Korea","code":"PRK"},"129":{"name":"Kenya","code":"KEN"},"130":{"name":"Jordan","code":"JOR"},"131":{"name":"Kazakhstan","code":"KAZ"},"132":{"name":"Jamaica","code":"JAM"},"134":{"name":"Iraq","code":"IRQ"},"136":{"name":"Indonesia","code":"IDN"},"143":{"name":"Cote d'Ivoire","code":"CIV"},"145":{"name":"Haiti","code":"HTI"},"146":{"name":"Guyana","code":"GUY"},"147":{"name":"Guinea","code":"GIN"},"148":{"name":"Guatemala","code":"GTM"},"150":{"name":"Ghana","code":"GHA"},"151":{"name":"Gambia","code":"GMB"},"153":{"name":"Gabon","code":"GAB"},"157":{"name":"Eritrea","code":"ERI"},"158":{"name":"Ethiopia","code":"ETH"},"159":{"name":"Equatorial Guinea","code":"GNQ"},"160":{"name":"Dominican Republic","code":"DOM"},"166":{"name":"Costa Rica","code":"CRI"},"167":{"name":"Democratic Republic of Congo","code":"COD"},"169":{"name":"Comoros","code":"COM"},"170":{"name":"Colombia","code":"COL"},"173":{"name":"Chad","code":"TCD"},"174":{"name":"Central African Republic","code":"CAF"},"211":{"name":"Maldives","code":"MDV"},"221":{"name":"Vanuatu","code":"VUT"},"234":{"name":"Suriname","code":"SUR"},"239":{"name":"Samoa","code":"WSM"},"258":{"name":"South Sudan","code":"SSD"},"259":{"name":"El Salvador","code":"SLV"}}}
