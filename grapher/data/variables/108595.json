updated: 7  February 2019 \n\nTarget 3.3: By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and \ncombat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases \nIndicator 3.3.1: Number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population, by sex, age and key \npopulations \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \n \nThe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nThe number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population, by sex, age and key populations as \ndefined as the number of new HIV infections per 1000 person-years among the uninfected population. \n \nRationale: \n \nThe incidence rate provides a measure of progress toward preventing onward transmission of HIV. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \nLongitudinal data on individuals are the best source of data but are rarely available for large populations. \nSpecial diagnostic tests in surveys or from health facilities can be used to obtain data on HIV incidence. \nHIV incidence is thus modelled using the Spectrum software. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nGeneral population, Age groups (0-14, 15-24, 15-49, 50+ years),  sex (male, female, both) \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\n \nEstimates are not collected from countries with populations < 250,000. In addition no estimates are \navailable for 10 countries with very small HIV epidemics who do not produce estimates.  \nFor some countries the estimates were not finalized at the time of publication.  The country specific \nvalues are not presented for these countries. \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 7  February 2019 \n\n \nThe countries with populations < 250,000 and the 10 countries that do not produce estimates are \nnot included in regional or global level estimates.  For countries in which the estimates were not \nfinalized at the time of publication, the unofficial best estimates are included in the regional and \nglobal values. \n \n\nRegional aggregates: \n \nAvailable for the World, the SDG regional groupings, LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \nThese variations will differ by country. \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \n \nA description of the methodology is available at:  \nhttp://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/Estimates_methods_2018.pdf \n \nCountries are providing with capacity building workshops every two years on the methods. In addition, \nthey are supported by in country specialists in roughly 45 countries.  Where no in country specialists are \navailable remote assistance is provided. Guidelines are also available at:  \nhttp://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/datatools/spectrum-epp and at www.avenirhealth.org \n \nQuality assurance \n \nhttp://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/Estimates_methods_2018.pdf \n \nCountries are fully involved in the development of the estimates.  The final values are reviewed for \nquality by UNAIDS and approved by senior managers at national Ministries of Health. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nSpectrum modelling, household or key population surveys with HIV incidence-testing, \n \nOther possible data sources: Regular surveillance system among key populations. \n \nCollection process: \n \nCountry teams use UNAIDS-supported software to develop estimates annually. The country teams are \ncomprised of primarily epidemiologists, demographers, monitoring and evaluation specialists and \ntechnical partners. \n \nThe software used to produce the estimates is Spectrum—developed by Avenir Health \n(www.avenirhealth.org)—and the Estimates and Projections Package, which is developed by the East-\nWest Center (www.eastwestcenter.org). The UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modelling and \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 7  February 2019 \n\nProjections provides technical guidance on the development of the HIV component of the software \n(www.epidem.org). \n \nData Availability \n\nDescription: \n \n169 countries in 2018 \n \nTime series: \n \n2000-2017  \n \nCalendar \n\n \nData collection: \n \nData sources are compiled all year long. The spectrum models are created in the first three months of \nevery year and finalized by June. The next report will be in July 2019.  \n \nData release: \n \nJune 2018, June 2019, etc.  \n \nData providers \n\n \nThe estimates are produced by a team consisting of ministry of health, national AIDS advisory groups and \ndevelopment partners.
