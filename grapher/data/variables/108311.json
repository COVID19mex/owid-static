sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage \nforests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss \nTarget 15.1: By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland \nfreshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line \nwith obligations under international agreements \nIndicator 15.1.1: Forest area as a proportion of total land area \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nForest area as a proportion of total land area \n \nRationale: \n \nForests fulfil a number of functions that are vital for humanity, including the provision of goods (wood \nand non-wood forest products) and services such as habitat for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, \ncoastal protection and soil and water conservation.  \n \nThe indicator provides a measure of the relative extent of forest in a country. The availability of accurate \ndata on a country's forest area is a key element for forest policy and planning within the context of \nsustainable development. \n \nChanges in forest area reflect the demand for land for other uses and may help identify unsustainable \npractices in the forestry and agricultural sector. \n \nForest area as percentage of total land area may be used as a rough proxy for the extent to which the \nforests in a country are being conserved or restored, but it is only partly a measure for the extent to \nwhich they are sustainably managed. \n \nThe indicator was included among the indicators for the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) (indicator \n7.1 “Proportion of land covered by forest”). \n \nConcepts: \n \nIn order to provide a precise definition of the indicator, it is crucial to provide a definition of  \n“Forest” and “Total Land Area”.  \n \n\n\fLast update: February 2018 \n\nAccording to the FAO definitions, Forest is defined as: “land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees \nhigher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds \nin situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use”. More \nspecifically: \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n\n• \n• \n\n• \n\nForest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant land \nuses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters. \nIt includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach a \ncanopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or more. It also includes areas \nthat are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management practice or \nnatural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years. Local conditions \nmay, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used. \nIt includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks, nature \nreserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental, scientific, historical, \ncultural or spiritual interest. \nIt includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares \nand width of more than 20 meters. \nIt includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or are \nexpected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least 5 meters. \nIt includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this area is classified as land \narea or not. \nIt includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations. \nIt includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover \ncriteria are met. \nIt excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil palm \nplantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under tree cover. \nNote: Some agroforestry systems such as the “Taungya” system where crops are grown only \nduring the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest. \n\n \nTotal land area is the total surface area of a country less the area covered by inland waters, like major \nrivers and lakes.  \n \nThe indicator is expressed as percent. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nAssessment of forest area is carried out at infrequent intervals in many countries. Access to remote \nsensing imagery has improved in recent years, but remote sensing techniques have limitations. In \nparticular there are limitations to assess land use (remote sensing primarily assesses land cover), and \nsome slow changes such as forest regrowth cannot easily be observed with remote sensing techniques \nand require long time periods in order to detect. In addition, forest area with low canopy cover density \n(e.g. 10-30%) are difficult to detect with remote sensing techniques. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \nForest area (reference year) / Land area (2015) * 100 \n \n\n\fLast update: February 2018 \n\nThis indicator can be aggregated to global or regional level by adding all country values globally or in a \nspecific region \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nNo further disaggregation of this indicator \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\n \nFor countries and territories where no information was provided to FAO for FRA 2015 (79 countries \nand territories representing 1.2 percent of the global forest area), a report was prepared by FAO \nusing existing information from previous assessments and literature search. \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\n \nSee above \n\n \nRegional aggregates: \n \nSince information is available for all countries and territories, regional and global estimates are produced \nby summation. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \nThe national figures in the database are reported by the countries themselves following standardized \nformat, definitions and reporting years, thus eliminating any discrepancies between global and national \nfigures. The reporting format ensures that countries provide the full reference for original data sources as \nwell as national definitions and terminology. Separate sections in the reporting format (country reports) \ndeal with the analysis of data (including any assumptions made and the methods used for estimates and \nprojections to the common reporting years); calibration of data to the official land area as held by FAO; \nand reclassification of data to the classes used in FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessments. \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \n \nAll data are provided to FAO by countries in the form of a country report following a standard format, \nwhich includes the original data and reference sources and descriptions of how these have been used to \nestimate the forest area for different points in time. \n \nDetailed methodology and guidance on how to prepare the country reports and to convert national data \naccording to national categories and definitions to FAO’s global categories and definitions is found in the \ndocument “Guide for country reporting for FRA 2015”, http://www.fao.org/3/a-au190e.pdf. \n \nQuality assurance: \n \nOnce received, the country reports undergo a rigorous review process to ensure correct use of definitions \nand methodology as well as internal consistency. A comparison is made with past assessments and other \n\n\fLast update: February 2018 \n\nexisting data sources. Regular contacts between national correspondents and FAO staff by e-mail and \nregional/sub-regional review workshops form part of this review process. \n \nAll country reports (including those prepared by FAO) are sent to the respective Head of Forestry for \nvalidation before finalization and publishing of data. The data are then aggregated at sub-regional, \nregional and global levels by the FRA team at FAO. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nFAO has been collecting and analysing data on forest area since 1946. This is done at intervals of 5-10 \nyears as part of the Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA). FRA 2015 contains information for 234 \ncountries and territories on more than 100 variables related to the extent of forests, their conditions, \nuses and values for three points in time: 1990, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. \n \nAll data are provided to FAO by countries in the form of a country report following a standard format, \nwhich includes the original data and reference sources and descriptions of how these have been used to \nestimate the forest area for different points in time.  \n \nOfficially nominated national correspondents and their teams prepare the country reports for the \nassessment. Some prepare more than one report as they also report on dependent territories. For the \nremaining countries and territories where no information is provided, a report is prepared by FAO using \nexisting information and a literature search. \n \nOnce received, the country reports undergo a rigorous review process to ensure correct use of definitions \nand methodology as well as internal consistency. A comparison is made with past assessments and other \nexisting data sources.
