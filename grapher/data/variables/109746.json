starting point was the <a href=\"https://population.un.org/Household/index.html#/countries/840\">United Nations Database on Household Size and Composition 2018</a>. \n\nThe UN database pulls from 4 different sources: \n1) Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS); \n2) the Demographic Yearbook (DYB) of the United Nations; \n3) IPUMS-International;\n4) Labor Force Surveys (LFS) of the European Union, Eurostat. \n\nWhere a country time series was composed of multiple sources, we favoured the source covering the most years. In cases where there was a tie between sources, we favoured the DYB, then IPUMS, DHS, and lastly LFS estimates. The DYB covered the largest number of countries and the LFS the least.  \n\nEuropean countries available in the UN data were dropped in favour of Eurostat statistics to produce the longest-running series from the same data source. \n\nData on New Zealand, Japan, the US, and Australia available in the UN data were also dropped in favour of the estimates produced by the countries' national statistical agencies to produce a longer series for each country. \n\nFinally, data from the OECD was used to supplement the dataset for 2011 for countries where data from other sources were unavailable. \n\nThe source for each observation can be found in the metadata spreadsheet <a href=\"https://owid.cloud/app/uploads/2019/11/living-alone-metadata-final_country_stan.csv\">here</a>. \n\nNotes:\nThe UN data included two observations for Tanzania in 2004 and two for Senegal in 2013. We favoured the observation produced later in the year to avoid under- or over-estimating the share of one-person households. The figures produced later in the year are a more sensible fit for their respective country series.\n\nNew Zealand in 1991 and 1996 uses the total number of households as the denominator. All other years use the total number of stated households. Stated households exclude cases where the household composition is unidentifiable and is used where possible.\n\nJapan in 1960, 1970, and 1975 includes \"group of six or more one-person live-in employees for business\". \n\nUnited States estimates in 1993 and 2011 are revised based on population from the most recent decennial census. \n\nThe OECD-32 average excludes Israel."}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United
