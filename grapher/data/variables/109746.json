starting point was the <a href=\"https://population.un.org/Household/index.html#/countries/840\">United Nations Database on Household Size and Composition 2018</a> which was then supplemented with census data from countries' national statistical agencies and OECD data for 2011 in cases where data from other sources were unavailable. \n\nThe UN database pulls from 4 different sources: Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Demographic Yearbook (DYB) of the United Nations, IPUMS-International, and Labor Force Surveys (LFS) of the European Union, Eurostat. Where there were multiple observations for a particular year we favoured the DYB, then IPUMS, DHS, and lastly LFS estimates. The DYB covered the largest number of countries and the LFS the least. \n\nThe source for each observation can be found in the metadata spreadsheet <a href=\"https://owid.cloud/app/uploads/2019/11/living-alone-metadata-final_country_stan.csv\">here</a>. We have favoured census data where it is available for a long-run period to avoid introducing jumps in the series as a result of alternating between sources. See the metadata spreadsheet above for the complete source breakdown. \n\nNote:\nNew Zealand in 1991 and 1996 uses the total number of households as the denominator. All other years use the total number of stated households. Stated households exclude cases where the household composition is unidentifiable and is used where possible.\n\nJapan in 1960, 1970, and 1975 includes \"group of six or more one-person live-in employees for business\". \n\nUnited States estimates in 1993 and 2011 are revised based on population from the most recent decennial census.
