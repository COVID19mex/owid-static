indicates with reasonable certainty  can be recovered in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The data series for total proved natural gas does not necessarily  meet the definitions, guidelines and practices used for determining proved reserves at company level, for instance as published by the US Securities and Exchange Commission,  nor does it necessarily represent BP’s view of proved reserves by country.  Reserves-to-production (R/P) ratio - If the reserves remaining at the end of any year are divided by the production in that year, the result is the length of time that those remaining reserves would last if production were to continue at that rate. As far as possible, the data above represents standard cubic metres (measured at 15ºC and 1013 mbar) and has been standardized using a Gross Calorific Value (GCV) of 40 MJ/m3. Source of data - The estimates in this table have been compiled using a combination of primary official sources and third-party data from Cedigaz and the OPEC Secretariat.","createdAt":"2019-11-20T13:20:05.000Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-20T13:20:05.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"","timespan":"","datasetId":4874,"sourceId":17605,"shortUnit":null,"display":{},"columnOrder":0,"originalMetadata":null,"datasetName":"BP Statistical Review of Global Energy","s_id":17605,"s_name":"BP Statistical Review of Global Energy (2019)","source":{"id":17605,"name":"BP Statistical Review of Global Energy (2019)","dataPublishedBy":"BP","dataPublisherSource":"","link":"http://www.bp.com/statisticalreview","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":""}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GBR"},"5":{"name":"Netherlands","code":"NLD"},"6":{"name":"Germany","code":"DEU"},"8":{"name":"Italy","code":"ITA"},"11":{"name":"Poland","code":"POL"},"12":{"name":"Russia","code":"RUS"},"13":{"name":"United States","code":"USA"},"17":{"name":"Algeria","code":"DZA"},"21":{"name":"Argentina","code":"ARG"},"23":{"name":"Australia","code":"AUS"},"25":{"name":"Azerbaijan","code":"AZE"},"27":{"name":"Bahrain","code":"BHR"},"28":{"name":"Bangladesh","code":"BGD"},"34":{"name":"Bolivia","code":"BOL"},"37":{"name":"Brazil","code":"BRA"},"38":{"name":"Brunei","code":"BRN"},"44":{"name":"Canada","code":"CAN"},"61":{"name":"Yemen","code":"YEM"},"62":{"name":"Uzbekistan","code":"UZB"},"65":{"name":"Egypt","code":"EGY"},"67":{"name":"Ukraine","code":"UKR"},"69":{"name":"Turkmenistan","code":"TKM"},"72":{"name":"United Arab Emirates","code":"ARE"},"73":{"name":"Trinidad and Tobago","code":"TTO"},"75":{"name":"Thailand","code":"THA"},"77":{"name":"Syria","code":"SYR"},"84":{"name":"Vietnam","code":"VNM"},"90":{"name":"Saudi Arabia","code":"SAU"},"92":{"name":"Romania","code":"ROU"},"97":{"name":"Peru","code":"PER"},"99":{"name":"Papua New Guinea","code":"PNG"},"101":{"name":"Pakistan","code":"PAK"},"102":{"name":"Norway","code":"NOR"},"103":{"name":"Nigeria","code":"NGA"},"113":{"name":"Mexico","code":"MEX"},"116":{"name":"Malaysia","code":"MYS"},"120":{"name":"Libya","code":"LBY"},"131":{"name":"Kazakhstan","code":"KAZ"},"133":{"name":"Israel","code":"ISR"},"134":{"name":"Iraq","code":"IRQ"},"135":{"name":"Iran","code":"IRN"},"136":{"name":"Indonesia","code":"IDN"},"137":{"name":"India","code":"IND"},"142":{"name":"Myanmar","code":"MMR"},"161":{"name":"Denmark","code":"DNK"},"170":{"name":"Colombia","code":"COL"},"171":{"name":"China","code":"CHN"},"208":{"name":"Kuwait","code":"KWT"},"217":{"name":"Oman","code":"OMN"},"226":{"name":"Qatar","code":"QAT"},"238":{"name":"Venezuela","code":"VEN"},"273":{"name":"Africa","code":null},"276":{"name":"Europe","code":null},"294":{"name":"North America","code":null},"355":{"name":"World","code":"OWID_WRL"},"25487":{"name":"Middle East","code":null},"25701":{"name":"Europe (other)","code":null},"33417":{"name":"Other Middle East","code":null},"33418":{"name":"Other Africa","code":null},"33419":{"name":"Other Asia & Pacific","code":null},"34608":{"name":"Asia Pacific","code":null},"35424":{"name":"South & Central America","code":null},"35428":{"name":"CIS","code":null},"35442":{"name":"Other CIS","code":null},"94023":{"name":"Other S. & Cent.
