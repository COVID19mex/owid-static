If one of the sub-\nindicators is negative (or stable when degraded in the baseline or previous monitoring year) for a particular \nland unit, then it would be considered as degraded subject to validation by national authorities. \n\nConcepts: \nThe assessment and quantification of land degradation is generally regarded as context-specific, making it \ndifficult for a single indicator to fully capture the state or condition of the land. While necessary but not \nsufficient, the sub-indicators address changes in different yet highly relevant ways: for example, land cover or \nproductivity trends can capture relatively fast changes while changes in carbon stocks reflect slower changes \nthat suggest a trajectory or proximity to thresholds.6  \n\nAs proxies to monitor the key factors and driving variables that reflect the capacity to deliver land-based \necosystem services, the sub-indicators are globally agreed upon in definition and methodology of calculation, \nand deemed both technically and economically feasible for systematic observation under both the Global \nClimate Observation System (GCOS) and the integrated measurement framework of the System of \nEnvironmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA). The ultimate determination of the extent of degraded land \nmade by national authorities should be contextualized with other indicators, data and ground-based \ninformation. \n\nAn operational definition of land degradation along with a description of the linkages among the sub-\nindicators is given in Figure 1. \n\n \n\n                                                           \n5 https://circabc.europa.eu/sd/a/06480e87-27a6-41e6-b165-0581c2b046ad/Guidance%20No%2013%20-\n%20Classification%20of%20Ecological%20Status%20(WG%20A).pdf  \n6 http://www2.unccd.int/sites/default/files/documents/2017-08/LDN_CF_report_web-english.pdf  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fFigure 1: Operational definition of land degradation and linkage with the sub-indicators. \n\nLast updated: 23 January 2018 \n\n \n\nLand cover refers to the observed physical cover of the Earth’s surface which describes the distribution of \nvegetation types, water bodies and human-made infrastructure.7 It also reflects the use of land resources \n(i.e., soil, water and biodiversity) for agriculture, forestry, human settlements and other purposes.8 This sub-\nindicator serves two functions for SDG indicator 15.3.1: (1) changes in land cover may point to land \ndegradation when there is a loss of ecosystem services that are considered desirable in a local or national \ncontext; and (2) a land cover classification system can be used to disaggregate the other two sub-indicators, \nthus increasing the indicator’s policy relevance. This sub-indicator is also expected to be used for reporting \non SDG indicators 6.6.1, 11.3.1 and 15.1.1. \n\nThere is an international standard for the sub-indicator on land cover9 which includes the Land Cover Meta \nLanguage (LCML), a common reference structure (statistical standard) for the comparison and integration of \ndata for any generic land cover classification system. LCML is also used for defining land cover and ecosystem \nfunctional units used in the SEEA, and closely linked to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \nclassification on land cover/land use. \n\n                                                           \n7 Di Gregorio, A. 2005.

SOC is an indicator of overall soil quality associated with nutrient cycling and its aggregate \nstability and structure with direct implications for water infiltration, soil biodiversity, vulnerability to erosion, \nand ultimately the productivity of vegetation, and in agricultural contexts, yields. SOC stocks reflect the \nbalance between organic matter gains, dependent on plant productivity and management practices, and \nlosses due to decomposition through the action of soil organisms and physical export through leaching and \nerosion.15 \n\nFor carbon stocks, IPCC (2006) contains the most relevant definitions and standards, especially with regard to \nreference values applicable for Tier 2 and 3 GHG reporting.16 In this regard, the technical soil infrastructure, \ndata transfer and provision of national reporting data is also standards-based.17 \n \nRationale: \nIn the last decade, there have been a number of global/regional targets and initiatives to halt and \nreverse land degradation and restore degraded land. Starting in 2010, these include the Aichi \nBiodiversity Targets, one of which aims to restore at least 15% of degraded ecosystems; the Bonn \nChallenge and its regional initiatives to restore more than 150 million hectares; and most recently the \nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG target 15.3.  \n\n                                                           \n10 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. 2005.

Reporting on the sub-indicators should be based \nprimarily, and to the largest extent possible, on comparable and standardized national official data sources. \nTo a certain extent, national data on the three sub-indicators is and can be collected through existing sources \n(e.g., databases, maps, reports), including participatory inventories on land management systems as well as \nremote sensing data collected at the national level.  \n \nRegional and global datasets derived from Earth observation and geospatial information can play an \nimportant role in the absence of, to complement, or to enhance national official data sources. These datasets \ncan help validate and improve national statistics for greater accuracy by ensuring that the data are spatially-\nexplicit. Recognizing that the sub-indicators cannot fully capture the complexity of land degradation (i.e., its \ndegree and drivers), countries are strongly encouraged to use other relevant national or sub-national \nindicators, data and information to strengthen their interpretation.  \n\nAs regards slow changing variables, such as soil organic carbon stocks, reporting every four years may not be \npractical or offer reliable change detection for many countries. Nevertheless, this sub-indicator captures \nimportant data and information that will become more available in the future via improved measurements at \nthe national level, such as those being facilitated by the FAO’s Global Soil Partnership and others. \n\nWhile access to remote sensing imagery has improved dramatically in recent years, there is still a need for \nessential historical time series that is currently only available at coarse to medium resolution. The \nexpectation is that the availability of high-resolution, locally-calibrated datasets will increase rapidly in the \nnear future. National capacities to process, interpret and validate geospatial data still need to be enhanced in \nmany countries; good practice guidance for the monitoring and the reporting of the sub-indicators in other \nprocesses will assist in this regard.  \n\nMethodology \n\n                                                           \n18 United Nations General Assembly. 2015.

A conceptual framework, endorsed by the \nUNCCD’s governing body in September 2017,21 underpins a universal methodology for deriving the indicator. \nThe methodology helps countries to select the most appropriate datasets for the sub-indicators and \ndetermine national methods for estimating the indicator. In order to assist countries with monitoring and \nreporting, Good Practice Guidance for SDG Indicator 15.3.122 has been developed by the UNCCD and its \npartners.  \n\nThe indicator is derived from a binary classification of land condition (i.e., degraded or not degraded) based \nprimarily, and to the largest extent possible, on comparable and standardized national official data sources. \nHowever, due to the nature of the indicator, Earth observation and geospatial information from regional and \nglobal data sources can play an important role in its derivation, subject to validation by national authorities.  \n\nQuantifying the indicator is based on the evaluation of changes in the sub-indicators in order to determine \nthe extent of land that is degraded over total land area. The sub-indicators are few in number, \ncomplementary and non-additive components of land-based natural capital and sensitive to different \ndegradation factors. As a result, the 1OAO principle is applied in the method of computation where changes \nin the sub-indicators are depicted as (i) positive or improving, (ii) negative or declining, or (iii) stable or \nunchanging. If one of the sub-indicators is negative (or stable when degraded in the baseline or previous \nmonitoring year) for a particular land unit, then normally it would be considered as degraded subject to \nvalidation by national authorities.  \n\nThe baseline year for the indicator is 2015 and its value (t0) is derived from an initial quantification and \nassessment of time series data for the sub-indicators for each land unit during the period 2000-2015. \nSubsequent values for the indicator during each monitoring period (t1-n) are derived from the quantification \nand assessment of changes in the sub-indicators as to whether there are has been positive, negative or no \nchange for each land unit relative to the baseline value. Although the indicator will be reported as a single \nfigure quantifying the area of land that is degraded as a proportion of land area, it can be spatially \ndisaggregated by land cover class or other policy‐relevant units. \n\nAs detailed in the Good Practice Guidance for SDG indicator 15.3.1, deriving the indicator for the baseline and \nsubsequent monitoring years is done by summing all those areas where any changes in the sub-indicators are \nconsidered negative (or stable when degraded in the baseline or previous monitoring year) by national \nauthorities. This involves the: \n\n(1) assessment and evaluation of land cover and land cover changes; \n(2) analysis of land productivity status and trends based on net primary production; and  \n(3) determination of carbon stock values and changes, with an initial assessment of soil organic \ncarbon as the proxy. \n\n                                                           \n21 http://www2.unccd.int/sites/default/files/sessions/documents/2017-09/ICCD_COP%2813%29_CST_L.1-1715678E_0.pdf  \n22 http://www2.unccd.int/sites/default/files/relevant-links/2017-\n10/Good%20Practice%20Guidance_SDG%20Indicator%2015.3.1_Version%201.0.pdf  \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: 23 January 2018 \n\nIt is good practice to assess change for interim and final reporting years in relation to the baseline year for \neach sub-indicator and then the indicator. This facilitates the spatial aggregation of the results from the sub-\nindicators for each land unit to determine the proportion of land that is degraded for the baseline and each \nmonitoring year. Furthermore, it ensures that land classified as degraded will retain that status unless it has \nimproved relative to the baseline or previous monitoring year.  \n\nLand degradation (or improvement) as compared to the baseline may be identified with reference to \nparameters describing the slope and confidence limits around the trends in the sub-indicators, or to the level \nor distribution of conditions in space and/or time as shown during the baseline period. The evaluation of \nchanges in the sub-indicators may be determined using statistical significance tests or by interpretation of \nresults in the context of local indicators, data and information.

Datasets that complement and support existing national indicators, data \nand information are likely to come from multiple sources, including statistics and estimated data for \nadministrative or national boundaries, ground measurements, Earth observation and geospatial information. \nA comprehensive inventory of all data sources available for each sub-indicator is contained in the Good \nPractice Guidance for SDG Indicator 15.3.1.  \n\nThe most accessible and widely used regional and global data sources for each of the sub-indicators are \nbriefly described here. \n\n1) Land cover and land cover change data are available in the:  \n\n(1) ESA-CCI-LC,27 containing annual land cover area data for the period 1992-2015, produced by the \nCatholic University of Louvain Geomatics as part of the Climate Change Initiative of the European \nSpace Agency (ESA); or  \n\n(2) SEEA-MODIS,28 containing annual land cover area data for the period 2001-2012, derived from \nthe International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) type of the MODIS land cover dataset \n(MCD12Q1). \n\n2) Land productivity data represented as vegetation indices (i.e., direct observations), and their derived \nproducts are considered the most independent and robust option for the analyses of land productivity, \noffering the longest consolidated time series and a broad range of operational data sets at different spatial \nscales. The most accurate and reliable datasets are available in the:  \n\n(1) MODIS data products,29 averaged at 1 km pixel resolution, integrated over each calendar year \nsince 2000; and  \n\n(2) Copernicus Global Land Service products,30 averaged at 1 km pixel resolution and integrated over \neach calendar year since 1998. \n\n                                                           \n26 http://support.unccd.int/ \n27 https://www.esa-landcover-cci.org/  \n28 https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod12.php  \n29 https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/dataprod/mod13.php  \n30 http://land.copernicus.eu/global/  \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: 23 January 2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n3) Soil organic carbon stock data are available in the:  \n\n(1) Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD), Version 1.2,31 the latest update being the current de \nfacto standard soil grid with a spatial resolution of about 1 km;  \n\n(2) SoilGrids250m,32 a global 3D soil information system at 250m resolution containing spatial \npredictions for a selection of soil properties (at six standard depths) including SOC stock (t ha-1); \n\n(3) Global SOC Map, Version 1.0,33 which consists of national SOC maps, developed as 1 km soil \ngrids, covering a depth of 0-30 cm. \n\nIn the absence of, to enhance, or as a complement to national data sources, good practice suggests that the \ndata and information derived from global and regional data sets should be interpreted and validated by \nnational authorities. The most common validation approach involves the use of national, sub-national or site-\nbased indicators, data and information to assess the accuracy of the sub-indicators derived from these \nregional and global data sources. This could include a mixed-methods approach which makes use of multiple \nsources of information or combines quantitative and qualitative data, including the ground-truthing of \nremotely sensed data using Google Earth images, field surveys or a combination of both. \n\nCollection process: \nData on the indicator and sub-indicators will be provided by national authorities (“main reporting entity”) to \nthe UNCCD in their national reports following a standard format every four years beginning in 2018 or \nthrough other national data platforms and mechanisms endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission. This will \ninclude the original data and reference sources, and descriptions of how these have been used to derive the \nindicator and sub-indicators. Eligible (i.e. developing) countries will receive financial and technical assistance \nin preparing their national reports from the UNCCD and its partners. \n\nOnce received, national reports will undergo a review process by the UNCCD and its partners to ensure the \ncorrect use of definitions and methodology as well as internal consistency. A comparison can be made with \npast assessments and other existing data sources. Regular contacts between the main reporting entity and \nUNCCD secretariat via a help desk system, and through regional, sub-regional, and national workshops, will \nform part of this review process, enable data adjustments when needed, and contribute to building national \ncapacities. The data will then be aggregated at sub-regional, regional and global levels by the UNCCD and its \npartners. \n\nData Availability \n\n \nDescription: \nIn many countries, national data for one or more of the sub-indicators are available.
