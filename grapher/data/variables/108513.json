implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for \nSustainable Development \nTarget 17.2: Developed countries to implement fully their official development assistance commitments, \nincluding the commitment by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross \nnational income for official development assistance (ODA/GNI) to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.20 \nper cent of ODA/GNI to least developed countries; ODA providers are encouraged to consider setting a \ntarget to provide at least 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to least developed countries \nIndicator 17.2.1:

the public effort that donors provide to developing \ncountries. \n \nConcepts: \n \nODA: The DAC defines ODA as “those flows to countries and territories on the DAC List of ODA Recipients \nand to multilateral institutions which are i) provided by official agencies, including state and local \ngovernments, or by their executive agencies; and ii) each transaction is administered with the promotion \nof the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective; and \n \nis concessional in character and conveys a grant element of at least 25 per cent (calculated
