The first edition of the indicator will provide a \nbaseline of the current state of implementation of these agreements. Subsequent indicator estimates will \nthen be able to show any progress made by countries.  \n \nAlthough the exact score will be important from one reporting year to the next for determining the \nprogress made by a country, to aid the interpretation of this indicator, the score will then be converted \ninto one of five bands as following: \n \n\nScore \n\nBands \n\n>0 –< 0.2 \n\n0.2 –< 0.4 \n\n0.4 –< 0.6 \n\n0.6 –< 0.8 \n\n0.8 – 1.0 \n\nBand 1: Very low implementation of applicable instruments to \ncombat IUU fishing \nBand 2: Low implementation of applicable instruments to \ncombat IUU fishing \nBand 3: Medium implementation of applicable instruments to \ncombat IUU fishing \nBand 4: High implementation of applicable instruments to \ncombat IUU fishing \nBand 5: Very high implementation of applicable instruments to \ncombat IUU fishing \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: 29 May 2018 \n \n\nAdditionally, a State may receive an indicator score of “N/A”, in the case that none of the instruments are \napplicable. This would only be the case if the country is land locked and does not flag any vessels that \nconduct fishing or fishing related activities.  \n \nCountries that do not submit a response to the questionnaire on which the indicator is based or do not \napprove the use of their responses to the questionnaire for use in this indicator, will not receive an \nindicator score. \n \nConcepts: \nThe definitions and concepts associated with the indicator and utilized in the methodology are defined in \nthe FAO term portal: http://www.fao.org/faoterm/collection/fisheries/en/ \n \nThis indicator is based on a country’s implementation of the different international instruments that \ncombat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU fishing). IUU fishing undermines national and \nregional efforts to conserve and manage fish stocks and, as a consequence, inhibits progress towards \nachieving the goals of long-term sustainability and responsibility as set forth in, inter alia, Chapter 17 of \nAgenda 21 and the 1995 FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Moreover, IUU fishing greatly \ndisadvantages and discriminates against those fishers that act responsibly, honestly and in accordance \nwith the terms of their fishing authorizations. This is a compelling reason why IUU fishing must be dealt \nwith expeditiously and in a transparent manner. If IUU fishing is not curbed, and if IUU fishers target \nvulnerable stocks that are subject to strict management controls or moratoria, efforts to rebuild those \nstocks to healthy levels will not be achieved. To efficiently curb the IUU fishing a number of different \ninternational instruments have been developed over the years that focus on the implementation of the \ndifferent responsibilities of States.  \n \nThe instruments covered by this indicator and their role in combatting IUU fishing are as follows: \n \n\n•  The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) \nThis instrument is the basis upon which all the subsequent instruments are built upon. UNCLOS \ndefines the rights and responsibilities of nations with respect to their use of the world's oceans, \nestablishing guidelines for businesses, the environment, and the management of marine natural \nresources. It is a binding instrument, although its principles may also be applied by countries who are \nnot party to it. \n\n \n\n \n\n•  The Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on \nthe  Law  of  the  Sea  of  10  December  1982  Relating  to  the  Conservation  and  Management  of \nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (UN Fish Stocks Agreement) \nThe UN Fish Stocks Agreement entered into force on 11 December 2001, and is the most \ncomprehensive of the binding international instruments in defining the role of Regional Fisheries \nManagement Organisations and elaborating measures that could be taken in relation to IUU fishing \nactivities. Although the UN Fish Stocks Agreement applies primarily to the highly migratory and \nstraddling fish stocks on the high seas, its broad acceptance and application is evidenced by the \nreinforcement of other international instruments, implementation at the regional level, and to some \nextent by State practice within areas of national jurisdiction. \n\n•  The  International  Plan  of  Action  to  Prevent,  Deter  and  Eliminate  Illegal,  Unreported  and \n\nUnregulated Fishing (IPOA-IUU) \n\n\fLast updated: 29 May 2018 \n \n\nThe objective of the IPOA is to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing by providing all States with \ncomprehensive, effective and transparent measures by which to act, including through appropriate \nregional fisheries management organizations established in accordance with international law. This \ninstrument covers all the aspects of a State’s responsibilities including, flag State responsibilities, \ncoastal State measures, port State measures, internationally agreed market-related measures, \nresearch and regional fisheries management organizations. \n\n•  The  2009  FAO  Agreement  on  Port  State  Measures  to  Prevent,  Deter  and  Eliminate  Illegal, \n\nUnreported and Unregulated Fishing (PSMA) \n\nThe FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and \nUnregulated Fishing entered into force on the 5th of June 2016. The main purpose of the Agreement \nis to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing through the \nimplementation of robust port State measures. The Agreement envisages that parties, in their \ncapacities as port States, will apply the Agreement in an effective manner to foreign vessels when \nseeking entry to ports or while they are in port. The application of the measures set out in the \nAgreement will, inter alia, contribute to harmonized port State measures, enhanced regional and \ninternational cooperation and block the flow of IUU-caught fish into national and international \nmarkets. \n\n \n\n \n\n•  The FAO Voluntary Guidelines for Flag State Performance (VG-FSP) \nThe FAO Voluntary Guidelines for Flag State Performance spell out a range of actions that countries \ncan take to ensure that vessels registered under their flags do not conduct IUU fishing, including \nmonitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) activities, such as vessel monitoring systems (VMS) and \nobservers. They promote information exchange and cooperation among countries so that flag states \nare in a position to refuse to register vessels that are \"flag-hopping\" by attempting to register with \nanother flag state or to refuse vessels that have been reported for IUU fishing. The Guidelines also \ninclude recommendations on how countries can encourage compliance and take action against non-\ncompliance by vessels, as well as on how to enhance international cooperation to assist developing \ncountries to fulfil their flag state responsibilities. \n \n•  The FAO Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management \n\nMeasures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas (Compliance Agreement) \n\nThe 1993 FAO Compliance Agreement entered into force on the 24th of April 2003. Its main purpose \nis to encourage countries to take effective action, consistent with international law, and to deter the \nreflagging of vessels by their nationals as a means of avoiding compliance with applicable \nconservation and management rules for fishing activities on the high seas. With respect to the role of \nRFBs, the preamble calls upon States which do not participate in global, regional or sub regional \nfishery organizations or arrangements to do so, with a view to achieving compliance with \ninternational conservation and management measures. \n\n \nComments and limitations: \nAside from the status of a country as party or non-party to an international agreement which is available \nas public record, the indicator is a self-analysis by the country of their state of implementation of the \nvarious international instruments. Although questions in the questionnaire will be accompanied by pop \nup guides describing any technical aspects or terms, there may be a small variance in interpretation by \ndifferent respondents. \n \n\n\fLast updated: 29 May 2018 \n \n\nAdditionally, due to the fact that responses are not provided by an independent source, responses could \nin theory be politically influenced. \n \nMethodology \n\nComputation Method: \nThe indicator is based upon responses by States to a certain sections of the questionnaire for monitoring \nthe implementation of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and related instruments (CCRF). \nThese are sections covering the implementation of different international instruments used to combat \nIUU fishing. The responses will be converted using an algorithm to obtain a score for the indicator. Each \ninstrument will be covered within a given variable, as follows: \n \n\nVariable 1 (V1) - Adherence and implementation of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the \nLaw of the Sea \nVariable 2 (V2) - Adherence and implementation of the 1995 United Nations Fish Stocks \nAgreement  \nVariable 3 (V3) - Development and implementation of a national plan of action (NPOA) to \ncombat IUU fishing in line with the IPOA-IUU  \nVariable 4 (V4) - Adherence and implementation of the 2009 FAO Agreement on Port State \nMeasures (PSMA)  \nVariable 5 (V5) - Implementation of Flag State Responsibilities in the context of the 1993 FAO \nCompliance Agreement and FAO Voluntary Guidelines for Flag State Performance \n\n \nDepending on responses by FAO Members on the adherence and implementation of the above-\nmentioned instruments, States will score an indicator value between 0 and 1. Each variable is given a \nweighting, which takes into consideration the importance of the instrument in combating IUU fishing as \nwell as the overlap between the instruments. The variable weightings are as follows: \n \n\nVariable  Weighting* \n\nV1 \nV2 \nV3 \nV4 \nV5 \n\n10% \n10% \n30% \n30% \n20% \n\n(*) item on “Applicability of instruments” \n\n \nFor binding agreements, States will still be able to score points if they are not party to the agreement but \nare implementing its provisions. States will also score points if they have initiated the process to \nbecoming party to an agreement.  \n \nThis indicator is automatically computed within the web-application on which the countries will be \nresponding to the questionnaire. Once the questionnaire is completed the respondent will be presented \nwith a report of the indicator, describing the methodology and the score attained. The user will then be \nable to give a final confirmation of the indicator. The final scores from all the respondents will \nautomatically be collected onto a database. This web-application will also allow the user to access in any \nthe following languages: English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic and Russian. \n \n\n\fLast updated: 29 May 2018 \n \n\nChoice of weighting per variable: \nThe weightings for each variable have been carefully selected. These have been determined based upon \ntheir importance of their role in combatting IUU fishing as well as in consideration of the overlap present \nin between the different instruments. It is also for this consideration of overlap that the VG-FSP and the \nCompliance Agreement have been combined into Variable 5. \n \nApplicability of instruments: \nA set of questions will be present to determine certain characteristics of States (coastal, port, flag and \nland-locked). This will ensure that the indicator scoring for a country is not negatively affected if an \ninstrument is not applicable to them. In such case, the weighing of the variable that is not applicable is \nredistributed into the remaining variables. In cases where none of the instruments is applicable, the \ncountry will get an indicator score of “N/A”. \n \n\nVariable  Cases in which Instruments are not applicable \n\nV1 \n\nV2 \n\nV3 \nV4 \nV5 \n\nThe only case where this instrument becomes not \napplicable, is when the State is land-locked and they are not \na flag state.  \nIs not applicable if the country is land-locked and not a flag \nState or a coastal State but is not a flag State or Port State. \nSame as Variable 2. \nSame as Variable 2. \nIs not applicable if the country is not a flag State. \n \n\n \n \nFor more details regarding the list of question, scoring and applicability, please refer to Appendix 1 and 2. \n \nDisaggregation: \nDue to nature of indicator, there will only be one score per country which could then be aggregated \nregionally or globally. \nTreatment of missing values: \n\n•  At country level \n\nIndicator will only be available for responding countries who approve of the use of their responses \nto the CCRF questionnaire for this indicator. \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\nData will only be aggregated from responding countries. \n \n\nRegional aggregates: \nRegional and global aggregates for this indicator will count the number of countries within a region or \nglobally that fall under each of the five bands, as a proportion of the countries within a region or globally \nthat have reported this indicator. This approach better illustrates the distribution of scores in each region \nand avoids determining a mean score for a region that assumes that non-reporting countries are equal to \nthe mean, which would not be appropriate for a means-of-implementation type indicator like this. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \nData for this indicator is not internationally estimated. \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \n\n\fLast updated: 29 May 2018 \n \n\nOnce the countries receive the questionnaire, they will have access to a manual that will guide the user \nalong the best process for completing the questionnaire. Due to the various themes that are covered \nwithin the questionnaire, it is essential that the focal point or user gather the responses using a well-\ncoordinated process involving all the relevant staff that are in charge of the work within the various \nthemes contained within the questionnaire, such as the focal point for the indicator. Additionally, the \nmanual will also have a section describing the methodology of the indicator. \n \nWithin the questionnaire application, the user will be able to find pop up guides embedded in the \napplication describing technical aspects or terms encountered. \n \nURL  to  the  authenticated  CCRF  questionnaire  application:  FAO  Questionnaire  for  Monitoring  the \nImplementation of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and Related Instruments \n\n \nQuality assurance \nThe questionnaire was created upon the request of the Members to the Committee on Fisheries. Within \nthis process, FAO would not be in a position to question the responses of countries. Equally, this would \nrequire independent analysis of the status of implementation in the field of all responding countries for \nevery edition of the questionnaire, a task that would require a substantial outlay of resources.   \n \nFAO is however carrying out national and regional workshops on the implementation of international \ninstruments to combat IUU fishing. During these workshops, the indicator is used a tool to understand \nthe situation within the countries, all the while ensuring that there is a clear understanding of the \nquestions or any other technical aspects relevant to this indicator.  \n \nFurthermore, once the user has completed the questionnaire, the user is able to extract a report of the \nindicator detailing their responses to the relevant questions and the corresponding scoring. The \nquestionnaire respondent will then be able to validate the indicator score, which will in turn be \nautomatically stored onto FAO databases. This system has been put in place, not only to ensure that no \nmistakes were made during the completion of the questionnaire but also to ensure transparency of the \nindicator process. \n \nData Sources \n\nDescription: \nFor the complete list of questions used for this indicator, please refer to appendix 1.  \n \nThe questionnaire is sent out to all FAO member States on a biennial basis. The questions used for this \nindicator will be included into the Committee on Fisheries Questionnaire for monitoring the \nimplementation of the 1995 FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and related instruments.  \n \nCollection process: \nThis questionnaire is run on a web-application, which automatically records the submissions from the \ncountries onto a database. The indicator will be extracted automatically from their responses, with a \nreport of the indicator shown to the respondent prior to final submission. This will ensure transparency \nof the process and will allow for final confirmation of the results. \n \n\n\fLast updated: 29 May 2018 \n \n\nIn the previous edition of this questionnaire, 90 States and the EU responded to a relevant section that \nwill be expanded to cover variable 1 of this indicator. The EU responded on behalf of its member States \nfor this particular section. The sample size will differ from year to year depending on the number of \nrespondents. The next questionnaire will be sent out towards the end of 2017 and remain open for 2-3 \nmonth period. \n \nData Availability \n\nDescription: \nThe data required for this indicator is not currently available. It will become available in early 2018 after \nthe closure of the 2017/18 edition of the Questionnaire for monitoring the implementation of the 1995 \nFAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries.
