Proved reserves","unit":"Thousand million barrels","description":"Notes: Total proved reserves of oil - Generally taken to be those quantities that geological and engineering information indicates with reasonable certainty  can be recovered in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The data series for total proved oil reserves does not necessarily  meet the definitions, guidelines and practices used for determining proved reserves at company level, for instance as published by the US Securities and Exchange Commission,  nor does it necessarily represent BPâ€™s view of proved reserves by country.  Reserves-to-production (R/P) ratio - If the reserves remaining at the end of any year are divided by the production in that year, the result is the length of time that those remaining reserves would last if production were to continue at that rate. Source of data - The estimates in this table have been compiled using a combination of primary official sources, third-party data from the OPEC Secretariat, World Oil, Oil & Gas Journal and independent estimates of Russian reserves based on official data and Chinese reserves based on official data and information in the public domain.  Canadian oil sands 'under active development' are an official estimate. Venezuelan Orinoco Belt reserves are based on the OPEC Secretariat and government announcements. Saudi Arabia's oil reserves include NGL's from 2017. Reserves include gas condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) as well as crude oil. Shares of total and R/P ratios are calculated using thousand million barrels figures.","createdAt":"2019-11-20T13:20:23.000Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-20T13:20:23.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"","timespan":"","datasetId":4874,"sourceId":17605,"shortUnit":null,"display":{},"columnOrder":0,"originalMetadata":null,"datasetName":"BP Statistical Review of Global Energy","s_id":17605,"s_name":"BP Statistical Review of Global Energy (2019)","source":{"id":17605,"name":"BP Statistical Review of Global Energy (2019)","dataPublishedBy":"BP","dataPublisherSource":"","link":"http://www.bp.com/statisticalreview","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":""}}},"entityKey":{"1":{"name":"United Kingdom","code":"GBR"},"8":{"name":"Italy","code":"ITA"},"12":{"name":"Russia","code":"RUS"},"13":{"name":"United States","code":"USA"},"17":{"name":"Algeria","code":"DZA"},"19":{"name":"Angola","code":"AGO"},"21":{"name":"Argentina","code":"ARG"},"23":{"name":"Australia","code":"AUS"},"25":{"name":"Azerbaijan","code":"AZE"},"37":{"name":"Brazil","code":"BRA"},"38":{"name":"Brunei","code":"BRN"},"44":{"name":"Canada","code":"CAN"},"61":{"name":"Yemen","code":"YEM"},"62":{"name":"Uzbekistan","code":"UZB"},"65":{"name":"Egypt","code":"EGY"},"69":{"name":"Turkmenistan","code":"TKM"},"71":{"name":"Tunisia","code":"TUN"},"72":{"name":"United Arab Emirates","code":"ARE"},"73":{"name":"Trinidad and Tobago","code":"TTO"},"75":{"name":"Thailand","code":"THA"},"77":{"name":"Syria","code":"SYR"},"79":{"name":"Sudan","code":"SDN"},"84":{"name":"Vietnam","code":"VNM"},"90":{"name":"Saudi Arabia","code":"SAU"},"92":{"name":"Romania","code":"ROU"},"97":{"name":"Peru","code":"PER"},"102":{"name":"Norway","code":"NOR"},"103":{"name":"Nigeria","code":"NGA"},"113":{"name":"Mexico","code":"MEX"},"116":{"name":"Malaysia","code":"MYS"},"120":{"name":"Libya","code":"LBY"},"131":{"name":"Kazakhstan","code":"KAZ"},"134":{"name":"Iraq","code":"IRQ"},"135":{"name":"Iran","code":"IRN"},"136":{"name":"Indonesia","code":"IDN"},"137":{"name":"India","code":"IND"},"153":{"name":"Gabon","code":"GAB"},"159":{"name":"Equatorial Guinea","code":"GNQ"},"161":{"name":"Denmark","code":"DNK"},"168":{"name":"Congo","code":"COG"},"170":{"name":"Colombia","code":"COL"},"171":{"name":"China","code":"CHN"},"173":{"name":"Chad","code":"TCD"},"201":{"name":"Ecuador","code":"ECU"},"208":{"name":"Kuwait","code":"KWT"},"217":{"name":"Oman","code":"OMN"},"226":{"name":"Qatar","code":"QAT"},"238":{"name":"Venezuela","code":"VEN"},"258":{"name":"South Sudan","code":"SSD"},"273":{"name":"Africa","code":null},"276":{"name":"Europe","code":null},"294":{"name":"North America","code":null},"355":{"name":"World","code":"OWID_WRL"},"25487":{"name":"Middle East","code":null},"25701":{"name":"Europe (other)","code":null},"33417":{"name":"Other Middle East","code":null},"33418":{"name":"Other Africa","code":null},"33419":{"name":"Other Asia & Pacific","code":null},"34608":{"name":"Asia Pacific","code":null},"35424":{"name":"South & Central America","code":null},"35428":{"name":"CIS","code":null},"35442":{"name":"Other CIS","code":null},"94023":{"name":"Other S. & Cent.
