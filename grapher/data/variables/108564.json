security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture \nTarget 2.5: By 2020, maintain the genetic diversity of seeds, cultivated plants and farmed and \ndomesticated animals and their related wild species, including through soundly managed and diversified \nseed and plant banks at the national, regional and international levels, and promote access to and fair \nand equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated \ntraditional knowledge, as internationally agreed \nIndicator 2.5.2: Proportion of local breeds classified as being at risk, not-at-risk or at unknown level \nof risk of extinction \n \nInstitutional information \n\n \nOrganization(s): \n \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n\n \nDefinition: \n \nThe indicator presents the percentage of livestock breeds classified as being at risk, not at risk or of \nunknown risk of extinctions at a certain moment in time, as well as the trends for those percentages. \n \nRationale: \n \nThe indicator has a direct link to “biodiversity” as animal or livestock genetic resources represent an \nintegral part of agricultural ecosystems and biodiversity as such. Further there are indirect links to \n“malnutrition”: Animal genetic resources for food and agriculture are an essential part of the biological \nbasis for world food security, and contribute to the livelihoods of over a thousand million people. A \ndiverse resource base is critical for human survival and well-being, and a contribution to the eradication \nof hunger: animal genetic resources are crucial in adapting to changing socio-economic and \nenvironmental conditions, including climate change. They are the animal breeder’s raw material and \namongst the farmer’s most essential inputs. They are essential for sustainable agricultural production. \n \nNo increase of the percentage of breeds being at risk or being extinct is directly related to “halt the loss \nof biodiversity”. \n \nConcepts: \n \nThis indicator was originally proposed for the Target 15.5, and it serves also as an indicator for the Aichi \nTarget 13 “Genetic Diversity of Terrestrial Domesticated Animals” under the Convention on Biological \nDiversity (CBD). It is described on the webpage of the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership (BIP), a network \nof organizations, which have come together to provide the most up-to date biodiversity information \npossible for tracking progress towards the Aichi Targets \n(http://www.bipindicators.net/domesticatedanimals). Further, it is presented in the Global Biodiversity \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\nOutlook 4, page 91 (see http://www.cbd.int/gbo/gbo4/publication/gbo4-en-lr.pdf) which is an output of \nthe processes under the CBD. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nBreed-related information remains far from complete. For almost 60 percent of all reported breeds, risk \nstatus is not known because of missing population data or lack of recent updates. \n \nGenerally, data collection should be possible in all countries. Updating of population size data at least \neach 10 years is needed for the definition of the risk classes. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \nThe indicator is based on the most up to date data contained in FAO’s Global Databank for Animal \nGenetic Resources DAD-IS (http://dad.fao.org/) at the time of calculation. Risk classes are defined based \non population sizes of breeds reported to DAD-IS. The risk class is considered to be “unknown” if (i) no \npopulation sizes are reported or (ii) the most recent population size reported refers to a year more than \n10- years before the year of calculation (10 year cut off point). \n \nLinks to official definitions/descriptions of the indicator are reported below: \n \nThe indicator is one out of a set of 3 sub-indicators which are defined in the document CGRFA/WG-AnGR-\n7/12/7 “Targets and indicators for animal genetic resources” \n(http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/026/me514e.pdf) and that are endorsed in their current form by \nthe Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at its the 14th Session (see par 28 CRRFA-\n14/13/Report at http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/028/mg538e.pdf).  \n \nThe indicator serves to monitor the implementation of the Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic \nResources. In this respect the indicator is presented in the “Status and Trends of Animal Genetic \nRescources-2014” (see http://www.fao.org/3/a-mm278e.pdf). \n \nRisk classes are defined as follows (see also FAO. 2007. The State of the World’s Animal Genetic \nResources for Food and Agriculture, edited by Barbara Rischkowsky & Dafydd Pilling. Rome. Accessible at \nhttp://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a1250e/a1250e00.htm.): \n\n•  Extinct: a breed is categorized as extinct when there are no breeding males or breeding females \n\nremaining. Nevertheless, genetic material might have been cryo-conserved which would allow \nrecreation of the breed. In reality, extinction may be realized well before the loss of the last \nanimal or genetic material. \n\n•  Critical: a breed is categorized as critical if the total number of breeding females is less than or \nequal to 100 or the total number of breeding males is less than or equal to five; or the overall \npopulation size is less than or equal to 120 and decreasing and the percentage of females being \nbred to males of the same breed is below 80 percent, and it is not classified as extinct. \n\n•  Critical-maintained: are those critical populations for which active conservation programmes are \n\nin place or populations are maintained by commercial companies or research institutions. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fLast updated: 11 July 2017 \n\n•  Endangered: a breed is categorized as endangered if the total number of breeding females is \ngreater than 100 and less than or equal to 1 000 or the total number of breeding males is less \nthan or equal to 20 and greater than five; or the overall population size is greater than 80 and \nless than 100 and increasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same \nbreed is above 80 percent; or the overall population size is greater than 1 000 and less than or \nequal to 1 200 and decreasing and the percentage of females being bred to males of the same \nbreed is below 80 percent, and it is not assigned to any of above categories. \n\n•  Endangered-maintained: are those endangered populations for which active conservation \n\nprogrammes are in place or populations are maintained by commercial companies or research \ninstitutions. \n\n•  Breed at risk: a breed that has been classified as either critical, critical-maintained, endangered, \n\nor endangered-maintained. \n\n \nDisaggregation: \n \nData are available by country. \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \n \nLivestock census on breed level or data derived from national herdbooks or national surveys. \n \nFAO. 2011.
