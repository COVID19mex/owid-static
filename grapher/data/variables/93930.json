The antenatal period presents opportunities for reaching pregnant women with interventions that may be vital to their health and wellbeing and that of their infants. Receiving antenatal care at least four times, as recommended by WHO, increases the likelihood of receiving effective maternal health interventions during antenatal visits. \nThis is one of the indicators in the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health (2016-2030) Monitoring Framework,  and one of the tracer indicators of health services for the universal health coverage (SDG indicator 3.8.1).\n\nDefinition\nThe percentage of women aged 15-49 with a live birth in a given time period that received antenatal care four or more times.\nDue to data limitations, it is not possible to determine the type of provider for each visit.\n \nNumerator:\nThe number of women aged 15-49 with a live birth in a given time period that received antenatal care four or more times.\nDenominator:\nTotal number of women aged 15-49 with a live birth in the same period.\n\nAssociated terms\nLive birth : The complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached. (ICD-10)\n\nPreferred data sources\nHousehold surveys\n\nOther possible data sources\nFacility reporting system\n\nMethod of measurement\nThe number of women aged 15-49 with a live birth in a given time period that received antenatal care four or more times during pregnancy is expressed as a percentage of women aged 15-49 with a live birth in the same period. \n(Number of women aged 15-49 attended at least four times during pregnancy by any provider for reasons related to the pregnancy/ Total number of women aged 15-49 with a live birth) *100\n\nThe indicators of antenatal care (at least one visit and at least four visits) are based on standard questions that ask if and how many times the health of the woman was checked during pregnancy.\n\nUnlike antenatal care coverage (at least one visit), antenatal care coverage (at least four visit) includes care given by any provider, not just skilled health personnel. This is because the key national level household surveys do not collect information on type of provider for each visit.\n\nThe indicators of antenatal care (at least one visit and at least four visits) are based on standard questions that ask if, how many times, and by whom the health of the woman was checked during pregnancy. Household surveys that can generate this indicator includes Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS), Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS) and other surveys based on similar methodologies.\n\nService/facility reporting system can be used where the coverage is high, usually in industrialized countries.\n\nMethod of estimation\nWHO and UNICEF compile empirical data from household surveys. Before data are included into the global databases, UNICEF and WHO undertake a process of data verification that includes correspondence with field offices to clarify any questions regarding estimates.\n\nPredominant type of statistics: adjusted\n\nM&E Framework\nOutcome\n\nMethod of estimation of global and regional aggregates\nRegional and global aggregates are weighted averages of the country data, using the number of live births for the reference year in each country as the weight. No figures are reported if less than 50 per cent of the live births in the region are covered. \n\nDisaggregation\n\n    \n\nUnit of Measure\nN/A\n\nUnit Multiplier\n\n    \n\nExpected frequency of data dissemination\nAnnual\n\nExpected frequency of data collection\nAnnual\n\nLimitations\nIt is important to note that this indicator do not capture the components of care described under \"Comments\" below. Receiving antenatal care during pregnancy does not guarantee the receipt of all of the interventions that are effective in improving maternal health. Receipt of antenatal care at least four times increases the likelihood of receiving the interventions during antenatal visits.\nThe indicator for four or more visits usually measures visits with any provider because national-level household surveys do not collect provider data for each visit. In addition, standardization of the definition of skilled health personnel is sometimes difficult because of differences in training of health personnel in different countries.\n\nRecall error is a potential source of bias in the data. In household surveys, the respondent is asked about each live birth for a period up to five years before the interview.  \n\nDiscrepancies are possible if there are national figures compiled at the health facility level. These would differ from global figures based on survey data collected at the household level.\n\nIn terms of survey data, some survey reports may present a total percentage of pregnant women with ANC from a skilled health professional that does not conform to the MDG definition (for example, includes a provider that is not considered skilled such as a community health worker). In that case, the percentages with ANC from a doctor, a nurse or a midwife are totaled and entered into the global database as the MDG estimate.\n\nLinks\nDemographic and Health Surveys (DHS)\n\nLinks\nReproductive Health Monitoring and Evaluation (WHO)\n\nLinks\nReproductive health indicators: Guidelines for their generation, interpretation and analysis for global monitoring (WHO, 2006)\n\nLinks\nUNICEF Data: Monitoring the Situation of Children and Women\n\nLinks\nSustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicators\n\nLinks\nIndicator and monitoring framework for the Global Strategy for Women's, Children\\'s and Adolescents\\' Health\n\nComments\nWHO recommends a standard model of four antenatal visits based on a review of the effectiveness of different models of antenatal care. WHO guidelines are specific on the content of antenatal care visits, which should include clinical examination, blood testing to detect syphilis & severe anemia (and others such as HIV, malaria as necessary according to the epidemiological context), gestational age estimation, uterine height, blood pressure taken, maternal weight / height, detection of sexually transmitted infections (STI)s, urine test (multiple dipstick) performed, blood type and Rh requested, tetanus toxoid given, iron / Folic acid supplementation provided, recommendation for emergencies / hotline for emergencies.\n\nANC coverage figures should be closely followed together with a set of other related indicators, such as proportion of deliveries attended by a skilled health worker or deliveries occurring in health facilities, and disaggregated by background characteristics, to identify target populations and planning of actions accordingly.\n\nContact Person\n\n
