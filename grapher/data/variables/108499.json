This refers to the number of countries that have a \nstatistical legislation which respects the principles of UNFOP. \n \nRationale: \nA country’s statistics law will be considered compliant with the UN Fundamental Principles of Official \nStatistics if the law has provisions relating to all ten Principles. \n \nConcepts: \nNational statistical legislation: The statistics law defines rules, regulation, measures with regard to the \norganization, management, monitoring and inspection of the statistical activities in a systematic way, \nstrength, effectiveness and efficiency to assure the full coverage, accuracy and consistency with facts in \norder to provide reference for policy direction, socio economic planning, and contribute to the \ncountry’s development to achieve wealth, culture, well-being and equity. \n \nUN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics  \nThe Fundamental Principles for Official Statistics adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission, in \nits Special Session of 11-15 April 1994 are: \n \nPrinciple 1. Official statistics provide an indispensable element in the information system of a society, \nserving the government, the economy and the public with data about the economic, demographic, social \nand environmental situation. To this end, official statistics that meet the test of practical utility are to be \ncompiled and made available on an impartial basis by official statistical agencies to honour citizens’ \nentitlement to public information. \n \nPrinciple 2. To retain trust in official statistics, the statistical agencies need to decide according to strictly \nprofessional considerations, including scientific principles and professional ethics, on the methods and \nprocedures for the collection, processing, storage and presentation of statistical data. \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 13 February 2018 \n\n \nPrinciple 3. To facilitate a correct interpretation of the data, the statistical agencies are to present \ninformation according to scientific standards on the sources, methods and procedures of the statistics. \n \nPrinciple 4. The statistical agencies are entitled to comment on erroneous interpretation and misuse of \nstatistics.  \n \nPrinciple 5. Data for statistical purposes may be drawn from all types of sources, be they statistical \nsurveys or administrative records. Statistical agencies are to choose the source with regard to quality, \ntimeliness, costs and the burden on respondents.  \n \nPrinciple 6. Individual data collected by statistical agencies for statistical compilation, whether they refer \nto natural or legal persons, are to be strictly confidential and used exclusively for statistical purposes.  \n \nPrinciple 7. The laws, regulations and measures under which the statistical systems operate are to be \nmade public.  \n \nPrinciple 8. Coordination among statistical agencies within countries is essential to achieve consistency \nand efficiency in the statistical system.  \n \nPrinciple 9. The use by statistical agencies in each country of international concepts, classifications and \nmethods promotes the consistency and efficiency of statistical systems at all official levels.  \n \nPrinciple 10. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation in statistics contributes to the improvement of \nsystems of official statistics in all countries. \n \nComments and limitations: \nInformation on the indicator is collected through a survey of NSOs. The low response rate (37%) means \nthat interpretation of the data is subject to caution. \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \nIndicator 17.18.2 = ∑countries of which the law has provisions relating to all the ten Principles \n \nDisaggregation: \nThere is no disaggregation level used for the indicator.  \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\nNo treatment of missing values at country level \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\nNo treatment of missing values at regional and global levels. \n \n\n\fLast updated: 13 February 2018 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n• \n\n \n\n \n\nRegional aggregates: \nNo treatment of missing values at regional and global levels. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \nNA. \n \nMethods and guidance available to countries for the compilation of the data at the national level: \n\n•  Methodology used for the compilation of data at national level \n\nPARIS21 SDG Survey through online form.   \n\nInternational recommendations and guidelines available to countries  \nPARIS21 pre-filled the survey for countries compliant with the European Statistics Code of Practice. \nThe European Statistics Code of Practice is coherent with the Fundamental Principles of Official \nStatistics.
