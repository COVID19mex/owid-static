Besides, corruption erodes public trust in authorities and the rule of law; when \nadministrative bribery becomes a recurrent experience of large sectors of the population and businesses, \nits negative effects have an enduring negative impact on the rule of law, democratic processes and \njustice. By providing a direct measure of the experience of bribery, this indicator provides an objective \nmetric of corruption, a yardstick to monitor progress in the fight against corruption \n \nConcepts: \n \nIn the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS), bribery is defined as: ‘Promising, \noffering, giving, soliciting, or accepting an undue advantage to or from a public official or a person who \ndirects or works in a private sector entity, directly or indirectly, in order that the person act or refrain \nfrom acting in the exercise of his or her official duties’. This definition is based on definitions of bribery of \nnational public officials, bribery of foreign public officials and official of international organisations and \nbribery in the private sector that are contained in the United Nations Convention against Corruption \n(articles 15, 16, and 21). \n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\nWhile the concept of bribery is broader, as it includes also actions such as promising or offering, and it \ncovers both public and private sector, this indicator focuses on specific forms of bribery that are more \nmeasurable (the giving and/or requesting of bribes) and it limits the scope to the public sector. \n \nThe concept of undue advantage is operationalized by reference to giving of money, gifts or provision of a \nservice requested/offered by/to a public official in exchange for a special treatment. \n \nThis indicator captures the often called ‘administrative bribery’, which is often intended as the type of \nbribery affecting citizens in their dealings with public administrations and/or civil servants. \n \nFor this indicator, public official refers to persons holding a legislative, executive, administrative or \njudicial office. In the operationalization of the indicator, a list of selected officials and civil servants is \nused. \n \nComments and limitations: \n \nIn the experience of several surveys conducted at national and international level, the so-called bribery \nprevalence rate is defined as the percentage of persons who paid at least one bribe (gave a public official \nmoney, a gift or counter favour) to a public official in the last 12 months, as a percentage of persons who \nhad at least one contact with a public official in the same period. In this formulation the share of \npopulation who was asked a bribe but did not give it is not included. Available data at national and \ninternational level usually refers to this formulation, while the collection of data according to the \nformulation included in the SDG framework will depend on the adaptation of relevant survey tools and \nthe calculation by national authorities. It is expected that data according to the current definition will \nbecome available gradually. \n \nOn a more general level, it should be noted that this indicator provides solid information on the \nexperience of bribery occurring in the interaction between citizens and the public sector in the context of \nservice delivery/transactions, while it does not cover other forms of corruption, such as ´grand \ncorruption´, trading in influence or abuse of power \n \nMethodology \n\n \nComputation Method: \n \nThe indicator is calculated as the total number of persons who paid at least one bribe to a public official \nin the last 12 months, or were asked for a bribe in the same period, over the total number of persons \nwho had at least one contact with a public official in the same period, multiplied by 100. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nRecommended disaggregation for this indicator are: \nage and sex of bribe-givers \ntype of official \nincome level of bribe-givers \neducation attainment of bribe-givers \n\n\fLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\n \n\n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\n \nMissing values are not imputed \n \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\n \nMissing values are not imputed. Global and regional estimates will be produced when data \navailability will improve. \n \n\nRegional aggregates: \n \nGlobal and regional estimates will be produced when data availability will improve. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \nFor the time being, only data from national sources are used. \n \nData Sources \n\n \nDescription: \n \nThis indicator is derived from household surveys on corruption experience and/or victimisation surveys \nwith a module on bribery. \n \nThe indicator refers to individual experience of the respondent, who is randomly selected among the \nhousehold members, while experience of bribery by other members is not to be included. Experience of \nbribery is collected through a series of questions on concrete contacts and experiences of bribery with a \nlist of public official and civil servants. \n \nThe denominator refers only to those persons that had at least one direct interaction with a public \nofficial/civil servant as they form the population group at risk of experiencing bribery. \n \nUNODC collects data on the prevalence of bribery through its annual data collection (UN-CTS). The data \ncollection through the UN-CTS is facilitated by a network of over 130 national Focal Points appointed by \nresponsible authorities. \n \nCollection process: \n \nAt international level, data are collected by UNODC through the annual UN-CTS data collection. Data are \non bribery indicator are sent to UNODC by member states, usually through national UN-CTS Focal Points \n(around 130 appointed Focal Points as of 2016) which in most cases are national institutions responsible \nfor data production in the area of crime and criminal justice (National Statistical Offices, Ministry of \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\nInterior, Ministry of Justice, etc.). When necessary, other data sources are used, including from websites, \npublications, other forms of communication. \n \nData for SDG monitoring will be sent to countries for consultation prior to publication. \n \nData Availability \n\n \nCountries that have at least 1 data point after 2010 for the indicator on bribery prevalence (see point 7.1) \nare: \n \nAsia and Pacific: 2 \nAfrica: 8 \nLatin America and the Caribbean: 2 \nEurope, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan: 9 \n \nCountries have at least 1 data point between 2000 and 2009 for this indicator: \nAsia and Pacific: 0 \nAfrica: 0 \nLatin America and the Caribbean: 4 \nEurope, North America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan: 2\" \n \nCalendar \n\n \nData collection: \n \nIII-IV quarter 2016  \n \nData release: \n \nII quarter 2017  \n \nData providers \n\n \nName: \n \n\n \nData on bribery are sent to UNODC by member states, usually through national UN-CTS Focal Points \nwhich in most cases are national institutions responsible for data production in the area of crime and \ncriminal justice (National Statistical Offices, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice, etc.).
