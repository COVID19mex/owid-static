They also set targets to measure progress in achieving the objectives defined in \n\nthe government’s planning documents.  \n\nThe definition of country-led results framework used for this indicator allows the possibility to use \n\nequivalent priority-setting mechanisms at the country level since not all countries articulate their \n\npriorities through consistent, integrated CRFs. \n\nIn practice, government-led results frameworks defined at the country level are often broadly stated (e.g. \n\nlong-term vision plans, national development strategies) and operationalised in more detail at the sector \n\nlevel (e.g. sector strategies), where specific targets and indicators are set for a given timeframe. \n\nSome examples of CRFs are long-term vision plans; national development strategies; joint government-\n\nmulti-donor plans; government’s sector strategies, policies and plans; subnational planning instruments, \n\nas well as other frameworks (e.g. budget support performance matrices, sector-wide approaches).

Using a \n\nminimal definition, these results frameworks include agreed objectives and results indicators (i.e. output, \n\noutcome, and/or impact). They also set targets to measure progress in achieving the objectives defined in \n\nthe government’s planning documents.  \n\nThe definition of country-led results framework used for this indicator allows the possibility to use \n\nequivalent priority-setting mechanisms at the country level since not all countries articulate their \n\npriorities through consistent, integrated CRFs. \n\nIn practice, government-led results frameworks defined at the country level are often broadly stated (e.g. \n\nlong-term vision plans, national development strategies) and operationalised in more detail at the sector \n\nlevel (e.g. sector strategies), where specific targets and indicators are set for a given timeframe. \n\nSome examples of CRFs are long-term vision plans; national development strategies; joint government-\n\nmulti-donor plans; government’s sector strategies, policies and plans; subnational planning instruments, \n\nas well as other frameworks (e.g. budget support performance matrices, sector-wide approaches). In \n\ncontrast, planning and priority setting documents produced outside the government, such as country \n\nstrategies prepared by development partners, are not considered CRFs. \n\nComments and limitations: \n\nData collection covered about 80 low and middle-income countries for the 2015-2016 period. The \n\nnumber of countries covered is expected to increase for the period 2018 and beyond.

Weighting by project size would otherwise \n\nover represent infrastructure projects and underrepresent interventions focused on influencing policies \n\nand institutional arrangements. Nevertheless, data on project size is available. \n\nDisaggregation: \n\nGiven the bottom-up approach in generating the indicator, disaggregation will be possible at the country \n\nlevel, at the development partner level, at the sector level, and at the development project level. \n\nWhile data collection is led at the country level, in a bottom-up approach, global and regional aggregates \n\ncan be used for monitoring internationally-agreed commitments related to strengthening country \n\nownership and better partner alignment with nationally-set development goals.     \n\nTreatment of missing values: \n\n•  At country level \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfill in these gaps. \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\npartners. \n\nRegional aggregates: \n\nThere is no treatment of missing values.

Using a \n\nminimal definition, these results frameworks include agreed objectives and results indicators (i.e. output, \n\noutcome, and/or impact). They also set targets to measure progress in achieving the objectives defined in \n\nthe government’s planning documents.  \n\nThe definition of country-led results framework used for this indicator allows the possibility to use \n\nequivalent priority-setting mechanisms at the country level since not all countries articulate their \n\npriorities through consistent, integrated CRFs. \n\nIn practice, government-led results frameworks defined at the country level are often broadly stated (e.g. \n\nlong-term vision plans, national development strategies) and operationalised in more detail at the sector \n\nlevel (e.g. sector strategies), where specific targets and indicators are set for a given timeframe. \n\nSome examples of CRFs are long-term vision plans; national development strategies; joint government-\n\nmulti-donor plans; government’s sector strategies, policies and plans; subnational planning instruments, \n\nas well as other frameworks (e.g. budget support performance matrices, sector-wide approaches). In \n\ncontrast, planning and priority setting documents produced outside the government, such as country \n\nstrategies prepared by development partners, are not considered CRFs. \n\nComments and limitations: \n\nData collection covered about 80 low and middle-income countries for the 2015-2016 period. The \n\nnumber of countries covered is expected to increase for the period 2018 and beyond.

Weighting by project size would otherwise \n\nover represent infrastructure projects and underrepresent interventions focused on influencing policies \n\nand institutional arrangements. Nevertheless, data on project size is available. \n\nDisaggregation: \n\nGiven the bottom-up approach in generating the indicator, disaggregation will be possible at the country \n\nlevel, at the development partner level, at the sector level, and at the development project level. \n\nWhile data collection is led at the country level, in a bottom-up approach, global and regional aggregates \n\ncan be used for monitoring internationally-agreed commitments related to strengthening country \n\nownership and better partner alignment with nationally-set development goals.     \n\nTreatment of missing values: \n\n•  At country level \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfill in these gaps. \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\npartners. \n\nRegional aggregates: \n\nThere is no treatment of missing values.

Using a \n\nminimal definition, these results frameworks include agreed objectives and results indicators (i.e. output, \n\noutcome, and/or impact). They also set targets to measure progress in achieving the objectives defined in \n\nthe government’s planning documents.  \n\nThe definition of country-led results framework used for this indicator allows the possibility to use \n\nequivalent priority-setting mechanisms at the country level since not all countries articulate their \n\npriorities through consistent, integrated CRFs. \n\nIn practice, government-led results frameworks defined at the country level are often broadly stated (e.g. \n\nlong-term vision plans, national development strategies) and operationalised in more detail at the sector \n\nlevel (e.g. sector strategies), where specific targets and indicators are set for a given timeframe. \n\nSome examples of CRFs are long-term vision plans; national development strategies; joint government-\n\nmulti-donor plans; government’s sector strategies, policies and plans; subnational planning instruments, \n\nas well as other frameworks (e.g. budget support performance matrices, sector-wide approaches). In \n\ncontrast, planning and priority setting documents produced outside the government, such as country \n\nstrategies prepared by development partners, are not considered CRFs. \n\nComments and limitations: \n\nData collection covered about 80 low and middle-income countries for the 2015-2016 period. The \n\nnumber of countries covered is expected to increase for the period 2018 and beyond.

Weighting by project size would otherwise \n\nover represent infrastructure projects and underrepresent interventions focused on influencing policies \n\nand institutional arrangements. Nevertheless, data on project size is available. \n\nDisaggregation: \n\nGiven the bottom-up approach in generating the indicator, disaggregation will be possible at the country \n\nlevel, at the development partner level, at the sector level, and at the development project level. \n\nWhile data collection is led at the country level, in a bottom-up approach, global and regional aggregates \n\ncan be used for monitoring internationally-agreed commitments related to strengthening country \n\nownership and better partner alignment with nationally-set development goals.     \n\nTreatment of missing values: \n\n•  At country level \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfill in these gaps. \n\n•  At regional and global levels \n\npartners. \n\nRegional aggregates: \n\nThere is no treatment of missing values.

Country  governments  lead and coordinate  data \n\ncollection  and  validation.  At  country  level,  data  are  reported  by  relevant  government  entities  (e.g.  the \n\nMinistry of finance/budget department for national budget information) and by development partners and \n\nstakeholders.  OECD  and  UNDP  are  supporting  countries  in  collecting  relevant  data  on  a  biennial  basis \n\nthrough the Global Partnership monitoring framework, and these organisations lead data aggregation and \n\nquality assurance at the global level. \n\nCollection process: \n\n(i) For the data collection process of the Global Partnership's monitoring exercise, a national coordinator \n\nis assigned from the country government. S/he typically comes from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the \n\nMinistry of Finance, or the Ministry of Planning.  \n\n(ii) The national coordinator collects inputs from development partners. The data is submitted to the \n\nOECD and UNDP monitoring team and subsequently undergoes a review round with the headquarters \n\n(iii) No adjustments are made to the data after they have undergone the validation process. \n\noffices of development partners.  \n\n \nData Availability \n\nEighty-one low and middle-income countries led the data collection process to set a baseline value for \n\nthe year 2015. New measurements for the indicator are collected every two years in a number of \n\ncountries, which is expected to increase for the period 2018 and beyond. \n\nData collected for the year 2015 set a baseline for those 81 low and middle-income countries and for at \n\nleast 100 development partners –including the 29 countries that are members of the OECD’s \n\nDevelopment Assistance Committee and the six major multilateral organizations in terms of development \n\nfinance (i.e. the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations Development \n\nProgramme, African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development \n\nBank). \n\n\fLast updated: 29 August 2018 \n\nData is collected biennially, starting from the year 2014.
