accountable and transparent institutions at all levels \nIndicator 16.6.1: Primary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved \nbudget, by sector (or by budget codes or similar) \n \nInstitutional information \n \nOrganization(s): \n \nWorld Bank (WB) \n \nConcepts and definitions \n \nDefinition: \n \nPrimary government expenditures as a proportion of original approved budget \n \nThis indicator measures the extent to which aggregate budget expenditure outturn reflects the amount \noriginally approved, as defined in government budget documentation and fiscal reports. The coverage is \nbudgetary central government (BCG) and the time period covered is the last three completed fiscal years. \n \nRationale: \n \nThe indicator attempts to capture the reliability of government budgets: do governments spend what \nthey intend to and do they collect what they set out to collect. It is a simple and intuitive indicator that is \neasily understood and the methodology is transparent and every rating easily verifiable. \n \nConcepts: \n \nAggregate expenditure includes actual expenditures incorporating those incurred as a result of \nunplanned or exceptional events—for example, armed conflicts or natural disasters. Expenditures \nfinanced by windfall revenues, including privatization, should be included and noted in the supporting \nfiscal tables and narrative. Expenditures financed externally by loans or grants should be included, if \ncovered by the budget, along with contingency vote(s) and interest on debt. Expenditure assigned to \nsuspense accounts is not included in the aggregate. However, if amounts are held in suspense accounts at \nthe end of any year that could affect the scores if included in the calculations, they can be included. In \nsuch cases the reason(s) for inclusion must be clearly stated. \n \nActual expenditure outturns can deviate from the originally approved budget for reasons unrelated to the \naccuracy of forecasts—for example, as a result of a major macroeconomic shock. The calibration of this \nindicator accommodates one unusual or “outlier” year and focuses on deviations from the forecast which \noccur in two of the three years covered by the assessment. \n \nVery detailed resources are available at: http://www.pefa.org/en/content/pefa-2016-framework. The \ndocument “Framework for assessing public financial management” is extremely useful \n(https://www.pefa.org/sites/pefa.org/files/attachments/PEFA%20Framework_English.pdf). There are \nseven Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Performance pillars containing a total of 31 \nindicators. The pillar containing this indicator is part of Pillar I which measures Budget reliability. \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\n \nComments and limitations: \n \nAlthough not all countries have used the methodology on an annual basis for this indicator, the \nmethodology relies on standard data sets for approved and final budget outturns which are commonly \nproduced at least annually in every country. The countries that have not used the methodology to date \nare primarily highly developed countries which would have less difficulty in providing the necessary data \nthan those in the lower and middle income categories that have been primary users of Public Expenditure \nand Financial Accountability (PEFA) to date. \n \nOne limitation of the indicator is that it is an aggregate indicator of budget reliability. While it can be \ndisaggregated across regions, it is not disaggregated across various budget subcomponents. Different \nindicators are used for assessing changes in expenditure composition in the PEFA framework. Also, while \nthis indicator is intended to measure budget reliability it should be understood that actual expenditure \noutturns can deviate from the originally approved budget for reasons unrelated to the accuracy of \nforecasts—for example, as a result of a major macroeconomic shock. However, the calibration of this \nindicator accommodates one unusual or “outlier” year and focuses on deviations from the forecast which \noccur in two of the three years covered by the assessment. Therefore, single year shocks are discounted \nallowing a more balanced assessment. \n \nThe broader context in which the indicator was developed is as follows. PEFA is a tool for assessing the \nstatus of public financial management and reporting on the strengths and weaknesses of Public Financial \nManagement (PFM). A PEFA assessment provides a thorough, consistent and evidence-based analysis of \nPFM performance at a specific point in time and can be reapplied in successive assessments to track \nchanges over time. The PEFA framework provides the foundation for evidence-based measurement of \ncountries’ PFM systems using 31 performance indicators that are further disaggregated into 94 \ndimensions. A PEFA assessment measures the extent to which PFM systems, processes and institutions \ncontribute to the achievement of desirable budget outcomes: aggregate fiscal discipline, strategic \nallocation of resources, and efficient service delivery. \n \nMethodology \n \nComputation Method: \n \nThe methodology for calculating this indicator is provided in a spreadsheet (titled “En PI-1 and PI-2 Exp \nCalculation-Feb 1 2016 (xls)”) on the PEFA website (http://www.pefa.org/en/content/pefa-2016-\nframework). It is also detailed in part 2 of the document “Framework for assessing public financial \nmanagement” \n(https://www.pefa.org/sites/pefa.org/files/attachments/PEFA%20Framework_English.pdf). \n \nScoring is at the heart of the indicator. A country is scored separately on a four-point ordinal scale: A, B, \nC, or D, according to precise criteria:  \n(A) Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 95% and 105% of the approved aggregate budgeted \nexpenditure in at least two of the last three years. \n(B) Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 90% and 110% of the approved aggregate budgeted \nexpenditure in at least two of the last three years. \n(C Aggregate expenditure outturn was between 85% and 115% of the approved aggregate budgeted \nexpenditure in at least two of the last three years. \n(D) Performance is less than required for a C score. \n \nIn order to justify a particular score, every aspect specified in the scoring requirements must be fulfilled. \nIf the requirements are only partly met, the criteria are not satisfied and a lower score should be given \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\nthat coincides with achievement of all requirements for the lower performance rating. A score of C \nreflects the basic level of performance for each indicator and dimension, consistent with good \ninternational practices. A score of D means that the feature being measured is present at less than the \nbasic level of performance or is absent altogether, or that there is insufficient information to score the \ndimension. \n \nThe D score indicates performance that falls below the basic level. ‘D’ is applied if the performance \nobserved is less than required for any higher score. For this reason, a D score is warranted when \nsufficient information is not available to establish the actual level of performance. A score of D due to \ninsufficient information is distinguished from D scores for low-level performance by the use of an \nasterisk—that is, D* at the dimension level. The asterisk is not included at the indicator level. \n \nThe coverage is budgetary central government (BCG) and requires data for three consecutive years as a \nbasis for assessment. The data would cover the most recent completed fiscal year for which data is \navailable and the two immediately preceding years. \n \nDisaggregation: \n \nThis is an aggregate national level figure. However, subnational figures can be obtained for countries with \ndecentralized government systems. \n \nTreatment of missing values: \n \n\n•  At country level \n\n \nNot imputed. \n \n\nRegional aggregates: \n \nNot applicable. \n \nSources of discrepancies: \n \nNot applicable as all figures are obtained from national budget data. \n \nData Sources \n \nDescription: \n \nThe Budget Laws of countries is the usual source of the approved budget of countries. The end-of-year \nfiscal reports (/budget execution reports) are the sources of the actual spending. This data is typically \nobtained from websites of the Ministry of Finance (MoF) or the national Parliament, or data are collected \nthrough communication with the MoF. \n \nCollection process: \n \nNot applicable. \n \n\n\f \n\nLast updated: 19 July 2016 \n\nData Availability \n \nDescription: \n \nData Availability 2010 to present (in terms of how many countries have at least 1 data point after 2010 \nfor this indicator) \nAsia and Pacific: 23;
