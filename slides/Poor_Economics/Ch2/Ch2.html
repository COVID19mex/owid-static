                <p>The slides in the following presentation, produced by the team at Our World in Data, are provided as a teaching resource to complement the book <em>Poor Economics</em>, by Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo.</br></br> Here we follow the main points from the second chapter, titled "A Billion Hungry People?". This chapter covers the link between poverty and malnutrition. </br></br> You find a links to slides for other chapters in this <a href="https://owid.cloud/slides/Poor_Economics/ToC/ToC.html">Table of Content</a>.</p>

                     <figcaption>An individual is considered to be undernourished when the dietary energy consumption is less than a pre-determined threshold. </br></br> The number of undernourished people in the world has declined since 1991. However, in 2016 we have seen an increase back to the level of 2009.

                        <p>Undernourishment is still very common in sub-Saharan Africa: about 18% of the population in this region do not consume sufficient calories.
                        </br></br>
                        This is the region with the highest rates of undernourishment; but this is also the region where we have seen the largest progress in recent decades. 
                        </br></br>In the MENA region rates are lower, but there has been no progress.</br></br>On the whole, the world average has almost halved since 1991.</br></br><em>(Note: In this interactive chart you can click on the option "Add country" to plot numbers for any country or world region. You can also select the "Map" tab to show levels for all countries. )</em></p>

                    <figcaption>
                        <p>Undernourished children are more prone to poor health outcomes, likely to have lower educational achievement, and to give birth to smaller infants in the future. Undernutrition is also associated with lower economic status and labour market opportunities in adulthood.
                        </br></br>
                        Stunting (this chart) and wasting (next slide) are important symptoms of malnutrition. In many countries more than a third of young children are stunted.

                        <p> In virtually all countries with available data, if we divided the total amount of available calories by the number of people, we would be able reach the threshold of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-per-person#world-map-of-minimum-and-average-dietary-energy-requirement-mder-and-ader">2,000 kilocalories per person per day</a>.</p>

                        <p> In fact, in every country in the world the total amount of available calories from crops (before animal feed and including imports and exports) is enough to reach the 2,000 kilocalorie threshold. In some countries almost ten times over!

                        </br></br>Food scarcity is certainly a problem in specific contexts. But the point is: malnutrition is much more than lack of supply.

                <h3>Permanently ending hunger requires more than a one-off push in incomes</h3>
                <h5>(i.e. there is little evidence of a 'food poverty trap')</h5>

                    <figcaption>
                        <p>If hunger prevented poor people from working and earning enough to buy sufficient food, we would see most people in poverty spending everything on food and necessities. This is rarely the case. 'Food poverty traps' seem to be uncommon.
                        </br></br>
                        In all low-income countries with data, food is less than 60% of consumer expenditures; while alcohol and tobacco are often <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-consumer-expenditure-on-alcohol-tobacco">more than 2% of household expenditures</a>. 
                    	</br></br>Even for very poor people within low-income countries, food expenditures increase much less than one-for-one with household budgets (and even when extra income does lead to more food expenditure, this doesn't always imply more calories, but rather better-tasting calories).
                    	In India, for example, percapita consumption of calories has gone down while incomes have gone up (see <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~deaton/downloads/Food_and_Nutrition_in_India_Facts_and_Interpretations.pdf">Deaton and Dreze 2009</a>).

                <h3>Malnutrition is not only about calories</h3>
                <h4>There is such thing as 'hidden hunger': independently of caloric intake, low consumption of key vitamins and minerals can also lead to malnutrition</h4>

                    <figcaption>
                     <p>Even when the amount of food consumed is sufficient in terms of calories, malnutrition can arise from micronutrient deficiencies (i.e. lack of key vitamins and minerals which are consumed in small quantities).
                     </br></br>
                      Anemia is an important example of 'hidden hunger'.

                    <figcaption>
                     <p> Micronutrient deficiencies can be met through judiciously balanced diets, or by taking fairly cheap supplements (e.g. pills) or fortified products (e.g. iodized salt).
                     </br></br>
                     This map shows the proportion of households who use iodized salt. As we can see, consumption remains very low in many low-income countries where iodized salt could make a huge difference.

            </section>

               <section>
                    <h4>The problem of nutrition requires thinking beyond quantity of food.</h4> 
                    <h5>The quality of food matters a lot, but following a careful diet is expensive even if food is cheap (information, time, and 'mental space').</h5>

           			 <blockquote> "The benefits of good nutrition may be particularly strong for two sets of people who do not decide what they eat: unborn babies and young children... Small differences in investments in childhood nutrition (in Kenya, deworming costs $1.36 USD PPP per year; in India, a packet of iodized salt sells for $0.62 USD PPP; in Indonesia, fortified fish sauce costs $7 USD PPP per year) make a huge difference later on. This suggests that governments and international institutions need to completely rethink food policy. Although this may be bad news for American farmers, the solution is not to simply supply more food grains, which is what most food security programs are currently designed to do."</blockquote> <p>(Banerjee and Duflo, Poor Economics, Page 48)</p>
