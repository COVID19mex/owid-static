</div><p>After <a title="World Population Growth" href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth/">the world population increased more than 400% over the 20th century</a>, population growth has slowed considerably: The fastest world population growth rate was already reached in the late 1960s, and it has been falling since.&#xA0;While the world population increased by 2% annually in the late 60s the world population is now growing at a rate of about 1%.</p><p>There are three primary determinants of global population growth: mortality, fertility, and population momentum. Falling mortality &#x2013; seen in increasing <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy">life expectancy</a> around the world and falling <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality/">child mortality</a>&#xA0;in every country &#x2013; contribute to an increase of the world population. </p><p>The decline of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate">fertility rates</a> on the other hand, &#x2013; the number of children per woman &#x2013; reduces population growth. The global average fertility rate was 5 children per woman until the end of the 1960s and has halved since then.</p><p>The UN projections for the global population growth rates, which have been produced since the 1950s, have a good track record in projecting the size of the global population as we will show in the last part of this entry.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div></section>

<section><h2 id="future-population-growth"><a class="deep-link" href="#future-population-growth"></a>Future population growth</h2><h3 id="two-centuries-of-rapid-global-population-growth-will-come-to-an-end"><a class="deep-link" href="#two-centuries-of-rapid-global-population-growth-will-come-to-an-end"></a>Two centuries of rapid global population growth will come to an end</h3><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>One of the big lessons from the demographic history of countries is that population explosions are temporary. For many countries the <em><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#the-demographic-transition-why-is-rapid-population-increase-a-temporary-phenomenon">demographic transition</a></em> has already ended, and as the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#the-global-fertility-rate-has-halved-in-the-last-50-years">global fertility rate has now halved</a> we know that the world as a whole is approaching the end of rapid population growth.</p><p>This visualization presents this big overview of the global demographic transition &#x2013; with the very latest data from the UN Population Division just <a href="https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/index.asp">published</a>.</p><p>As we explore at the beginning of the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth">entry on population growth</a>, the global population grew only very slowly up to 1700 &#x2013; only 0.04% per year. In the many millennia up to that point in history <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-in-the-past">very high mortality of children</a> counteracted high fertility. The world was in the first stage of the demographic transition.</p><p>Once <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-global-overview">health improved and mortality declined</a> things changed quickly. Particularly over the course of the 20th century: Over the last 100 years global population more than quadrupled.&#xA0;As we see in the chart, the rise of the global population got steeper and steeper and you have just lived through the steepest increase of that curve. This also means that your existence is a tiny part of the reason why that curve is so steep.</p><p>The 7-fold increase of the world population over the course of two centuries amplified humanity&#x2019;s impact on the natural environment. To provide space, food, and resources for a large world population in a way that is sustainable into the distant future is without question one of the large, serious challenges for our generation. We should not make the mistake of underestimating the task ahead of us. Yes, I expect new generations <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-03-14/want-to-help-fight-climate-change-have-more-children">to contribute</a>, but for now it is upon us to provide for them. Population growth is still fast: Every year 140 million are born and 58 million die&#xA0;&#x2013; the difference is the number of people that we add to the world population in a year: 82 million.</p><p>Where do we go from here?</p><p>In red you see the annual population growth rate (that is, the percentage change in population per year) of the global population. It peaked around half a century ago. Peak population growth was reached in 1968 with an annual growth of 2.1%.&#xA0;Since then the increase of the world population has slowed and today grows by just over 1% per year. This slowdown of population growth was not only predictable, but <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#how-accurate-have-population-projections-been">predicted</a>. Just as expected by demographers (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#the-demographic-transition-why-is-rapid-population-increase-a-temporary-phenomenon">here</a>), the world as a whole is experiencing the closing of a massive demographic transition.</p><p>This chart also shows how the United Nations envision the slow ending of the global demographic transition. As population growth continues to decline, the curve representing the world population is getting less and less steep. By the end of the century &#x2013; when global population growth will have fallen to 0.1% according to the UN&#x2019;s projection &#x2013; the world will be very close to the end of the demographic transition. It is hard to know the population dynamics beyond 2100; it will depend upon the fertility rate and as we discuss in our entry on fertility rates <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate#fertility-is-first-falling-with-development-and-then-rising-with-development">here</a>&#xA0;fertility is first falling with development &#x2013; and then rising with development. The question will be whether it will rise above an average 2 children per woman.</p><p>The world enters the last phase of the demographic transition and this means we will not repeat the past. The global population has quadrupled over the course of the 20th century, but it will not double anymore over the course of this century.</p><p>The world population will reach a size, which compared to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#how-has-world-population-growth-changed-over-time">humanity&#x2019;s history</a>, will be extraordinary; if the UN projections are accurate (they <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#how-accurate-have-population-projections-been">have</a> a good track record), the world population will have increased more than 10-fold over the span of 250 years.</p><p>We are on the way to a new balance. The big global demographic transition that the world entered more than two centuries ago is then coming to an end: This new equilibrium is different from the one in the past when it was the very high mortality that kept population growth in check. In the new balance it will be low fertility keeps population changes small.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><div class="wp-block-image">

The world is reaching peak child</strong></h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>Following decades of very fast population growth, there is often concern that population growth is out-of-control: that an end to growth is not in sight.</p><p>But we know this is not true: population growth is slowing and will come to an end. How do we know? The world is approaching &#x2018;peak child&#x2019;, the moment in demographic history when the number of children in the world stops increasing. This is pre-emptive of the moment in history when the population stops increasing.</p><p>The world is approaching what the late Hans Rosling called &#x201C;the age of peak child&#x201D;. The solid purple line in the visualisation indicates the total population of people under the age of 5, and the dotted purple line shows projections for this age group through 2100. As we can see, we are not far away from the largest cohort of children that there will likely ever be. The gray lines show the total world population &#x2013; we expect an end to population growth as the number of children in the world begins to decrease.</p><p>This is an extraordinary moment in global history. In the past only two children per woman reached adulthood &#x2013; if more had survived the population size would have not been stable. This also means that the extended family with many children, that we often associate with the past, was only a reality for glimpse in time. Only the few generations during the population boom lived in families with many children &#x2013; before and after two children are the norm. The future will resemble our past, except that the children are not dying, but are never born in the first place.</p><p>Between 1950 and today it was mostly a widening of the entire pyramid that was responsible for the increase of the world population. What is responsible for the increase of the world population from now on is not a widening of the the base, but a fill up of the population above the base. Not children will be added to the world population, but people in working age and old age.At a country level &#x201C;peak child&#x201D; is followed by a time in which the country benefits from a &#x201C;demographic dividend&#x201D;. The demographic structure of a country is reshaped so that the proportion of people in working age rises and that of the dependent young generation falls. The demographic dividend can result in a rise of productive contributions and a growing economy.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a> Now there is reason to expect that the world as a whole benefits from a &#x201C;demographic dividend&#x201D;.</p><p>The big demographic transition that the world entered more than a century ago is coming to an end: Global population growth peaked half a century ago, the number of babies is reaching its peak, and the age profile of the women in the world is changing so that &#x2018;population momentum&#x2019; is slowly losing its momentum. This is not to say that feeding and supporting a still rising world population will be easy, but we are certainly on the way to a new balance where it&#x2019;s not high mortality keeping population growth in check, but low fertility rates.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-population-and-projected-growth-to-2100-total-population-and-under-age-5?time=1950..2100" class="grapherPreview">

Although the world population is still rising at the end of the century, it&#x2019;s doing so very slowly. We would therefore expect growth to come to an end very soon after 2100.</p><p>Under this scenario, it&#x2019;s projected the world population will be around 11.2 billion in 2100. We would therefore expect &#x2018;peak population&#x2019; to occur early in the 22nd century, at not much more than 11.2 billion.</p><p>These projections are of course sensitive to development and changes in the decades which follow. The WC-IIASA projections place strong emphasis on the importance of increased education &#x2013; particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. This is expected to lead to a faster reduction in fertility rates.

Here we see that today Africa has just over 17% of the global population; by 2100 this is projected to rise to 40%. Asia will see a significant fall from almost 60% today to just over 40% in 2100.</p><p>By the end of the century, more than 8 out of every 10 people in the world will live in Asia or Africa.</p><p>North, Central and South America, and Oceania, are projected to also see a rise in population this century &#x2013; but this growth will be much more modest relative to growth in Africa. Europe is the only region where population is expected to fall &#x2013; today its population stands at around 747 million; by 2100 this is projected to fall to 630 million.</p><p>These changes will bring new opportunities and challenges. Extreme poverty, for example, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty#is-the-world-on-track-to-end-extreme-poverty-by-2030">is expected to</a> become increasingly concentrated in Africa in the decades which follow.

The UN projections are called &#x2018;assessments&#x2019; and a new update is published in their <em>World Population Prospects</em> series every two years. The scenario which the UN researchers see as the most likely scenario is the Medium Variant projection. But in addition to their main Medium projection the UN Population Division are additionally publishing a High and Low variant, which simply assume that the total fertility rates are 0.5 higher and 0.5 lower than the Medium variant by the end of this century in every country.</p><p>But there are also a number of other institutions that are preparing their own projections of the world population. Global population projections are also published by the US Census, the Population Reference Bureau (PRB), and by the closely related Austrian research centers IIASA and the Wittgenstein Centre. The World Bank also published projections for some time but has stopped doing so in the mid&#x2013;90s.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><h3 id="the-wc-iiasa-population-projections"><a class="deep-link" href="#the-wc-iiasa-population-projections"></a>The WC-IIASA population projections </h3><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><h4 id="how-do-investments-in-education-now-matter-for-global-population-growth-in-the-21st-century"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-do-investments-in-education-now-matter-for-global-population-growth-in-the-21st-century"></a>How do investments in education now matter for global population growth in the 21st century?</h4></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div><div class="wp-block-columns has-2-columns is-style-sticky-right"><div class="wp-block-column"><p>A set of influential projections is published by IIASA and the Wittgenstein Centre, which I refer to as the WC-IIASA projections.<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p><p>Projections of the global population are uncertain and much of the uncertainty comes from the fact that we do not know which investments the world will make in those systems that determine mortality and fertility &#x2013; most importantly in education, as we have just seen.</p><p>The WC-IIASA projections differ from the work of the United Nations in a number of <a href="http://blog.iiasa.ac.at/2014/09/23/9-billion-or-11-billion-the-research-behind-new-population-projections/">fundamental ways</a>. The UN projections are taking into account the empirical data on each country&#x2019;s demography and are building projections based on this quantitative information. In contrast to this the WC-IIASA projections are also taking into account the qualitative assessments of 550 demographers from around the world which the WC-IIASA researchers have surveyed to gather their ideas on how the population change in different parts of the world will play out. They then combine the country specific expertise of these researchers with similar quantitative information that the UN and others rely on as well.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a> The work by WC-IIASA is highly respected among demographers and key publications by the researchers are regularly published in the scientific journal <em>Nature</em>.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a></p><p>The WC-IIASA projections are taking into account the demographic structure of the educational attainment of the population. While other projections are only structuring the demographic data by sex and age-group, the WC-IIASA data is additionally breaking down the population data by the level of highest educational attainment of different parts of the population. This information on educational attainment is then used for both the output of the model &#x2013; so that population projections for each country of the world by highest educational attainment are available (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/projections-of-future-education/">also on Our World in Data</a>). And crucially the information on education is also used as an an input into the model, so that the impact of different future scenarios for education on both mortality and fertility can be modeled explicitly.</p><p>The level of highest educational attainment is categorized in a system that aims to capture the structure of populations across the different country-specific educational systems. These categorizations are based on the the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), which was designed by the UNESCO to make education statistics comparable across countries. WC-IIASA breaks down the educational structure into the following 6 categories and the table summarizes how the six categories are defined, how they correspond to ISCED 1997, and the main allocation rules the researchers used.</p><p>For children younger than 15 years old no educational attainment information is available as most of them are still in the process of education.</p></div><div class="wp-block-column"><h6>Categories of educational attainment used by IIASA-WC and how they correspond to the ISCED levels<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a></h6><div class="wp-block-image">

The WC-IIASA projections are particularly helpful for the discussion here as they are the only projections that break down the demographic projections by the educational level of the populations and then model how different educational scenarios would affect the fertility rate in countries across the world. This then allows comparisons of how education matters for the size and distribution of the future population of the planet.</p><p>The researchers developed 4 different basic scenarios and a larger number of combinations based on these scenarios:</p><p><strong>Constant Enrollment Numbers (CEN):</strong> This is the researcher&#x2019;s most pessimistic scenario. Here it is assumed that no more schools are being opened in any place in the world so that the absolute number of people reaching a particular educational level is frozen at the current number. This means that enrollment rates are declining when the population size increases.<br></p><p>In practice the WC-IIASA researchers almost always consider CER as the most pessimistic scenario and only rarely discuss CEN.</p><p><strong>Constant Enrollment Rates (CER)</strong>: This is another pessimistic scenario. While in the CEN scenario the absolute <em>number</em>&#xA0;of enrolled students stagnates, the assumption in the CER scenario is that the <em>rate </em>of enrollment stagnates. In this scenario the most recently observed rates of educational enrollment are frozen at their current rate and no further improvement in enrollment is assumed.<br></p><p>This will still result in further improvements of adult education because in many countries the younger cohorts are better educated than the older ones. But in the longer run this scenario also implies stagnation.</p><p><strong>Fast Track (FT):</strong> This scenario is the most optimistic one and here it is assumed that countries follow the most rapid education expansion achieved in recent history which is that of South Korea.</p><p><strong>Global Education Trend (GET):</strong> This is the middle scenario and here the researchers assume that countries will follow the average path of educational expansion that other countries already further advanced in this process have experienced.&#xA0;In this scenario the researchers project the medium future trajectory based on the experience of all countries over the past 40 years<br> The researchers write:&#xA0;&#x201C;The GET scenario is moderately optimistic, and can be considered as the most likely.&#x201D;<a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a></p></div><div class="wp-block-column"></div></div></section>
