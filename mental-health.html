We address substance use disorders (alcohol and drug use disorders) in a separate entry on <a href="/substance-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Substance Use</a>.</p><p>Most of the estimates presented in this entry are produced by the <em>Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</em> and reported in their flagship <em>Global Burden of Disease</em> study.</p><p>Mental health and substance use disorders are still significantly under-reported. This is true across all countries, but particularly at lower incomes where data is more scarce, and attention and treatment for mental health disorders are significantly lower.</p><p>Mental health disorders are complex and can take many forms. The underlying sources of the data presented in this entry apply specific definitions (which we describe in each relevant section), typically in accordance with&#xA0;WHO&apos;s <em>International Classification of Diseases</em> (ICD-10). This broad definition incorporates many forms, including mental health disorders (depression, anxiety, bipolar, eating disorders and schizophrenia), as well as neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and developmental intellectual disabilities. The presentation of this diverse range of disorders, as categorised by the World Health Organization does not imply that they are comparable, or that their impacts and potential approaches of support or treatment should be treated similarly.</p><p>The complexity of mental health disorders means that the use of such definitions are also likely to underestimate its prevalence; many cases will undoubtedly fall outwith these definitions, but does not preclude them from being recognised as mental health disorders.</p><p>Mental health disorders remain widely under-reported&#xA0;&#x2014; in our section on <a href="/mental-health/#data-availability-on-mental-health">Data Quality &amp; Definitions</a> we discuss the challenges of dealing with this data. Figures presented in this entry should be taken as estimates of mental health disorder prevalence&#xA0;&#x2014; they do not strictly reflect diagnosis data (which would provide the global perspective on diagnosis, rather than actual prevalence differences), but are imputed from a combination of medical, epidemiological data, surveys and meta-regression modelling where raw data is unavailable. Further information can be found at our section on Data Quality &amp; Definitions.</p><p>In many cases, we may therefore consider reported estimates to be an under-estimation of true prevalence and disease burden. It is also important to keep in mind that the uncertainty of the data on mental health is generally high so that one should be cautious about interpreting changes over time and differences between countries. Even taking into account that mental health disorders are likely underreported, the data presented in this entry demonstrate that mental health disorders are common and have a high prevalence. Improving awareness, recognition, support and treatment for this range of disorders should therefore be an essential focus for global health.</p></section>

Full definitions of disorders used by the Institute for Health and Metrics Evaluation (IHME) can be found in the relevant disorder section of this entry.</p><p>In this entry, we focus only on mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders &#x2014; specific data on alcohol and drug use disorders can be found in our entry on <a href="/substance-use">Substance Use</a>. You can find statistics on the combined prevalence of all of these disorders (including substance use) <a href="/grapher/share-with-mental-and-substance-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> &#x2013; as can be seen this linked world map, across most countries, approximately 15-20 percent of the population are experiencing a mental health and/or substance use disorder. This equates to every fifth or sixth person.</p><p>The map below excludes substance use disorders and reports the estimated share of the population with at least one of the range of mental health and neurodevelopmental disorders. Across the world, mental health disorders are very common. The highest reported prevalence is Iran, Australia and New Zealand, where around every 5th or 6th person is experiencing one or more within this group of disorders. These are, however, not large outliers &#x2013; in all countries the share is higher than 10%.</p><p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="/grapher/share-with-mental-health-or-development-disorder" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p><p>The scatterplot compares the prevalence of these disorders between males and females. Taken together we see that in most countries mental health problems are more common for women than for men. However, as is shown later in this entry this varies significantly by disorder type: on average, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and bipolar disorder is more prevalent in women. Gender differences in schizophrenia prevalence are mixed across countries, but typically more common in men.</p><p><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;" src="/grapher/share-with-mental-health-males-vs-females" width="300" height="150"></iframe></p><h4 id="number-of-people-with-mental-and-neurodevelopmental-disorders"><a class="deep-link" href="#number-of-people-with-mental-and-neurodevelopmental-disorders"></a>Number of people with mental and neurodevelopmental disorders</h4><p>It&apos;s estimated that, globally, close to 950 million people have a mental or neurodevelopmental disorder.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a> This split between males and females is similar, with an estimated 486 million females, and 462 million males in 2016.

<li>The first is that from the perspective of mortality, direct deaths typically only result from alcohol, drug use and eating disorders. However, suicide deaths are also strongly linked&#xA0;&#x2014; although not always attributed to&#xA0;&#x2014; mental health disorders. We discuss the evidence of this link between mental health and suicide <a href="/mental-health/#link-between-mental-health-and-suicide">later in this entry</a>. It is nonetheless recognized that a given share of suicide deaths are attributed to this group of disorders; including this proportion of suicides would significantly increase the total attributed number of deaths.</li>
<li>Measuring the health impact by mortality alone fails to capture the impact that mental health disorders have on an individual&apos;s wellbeing. The &apos;<a href="/burden-of-disease">disease burden</a>&apos; &#x2013; measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) &#x2013; is a considers not only the mortality associated with a disorder, but also years lived with disability or health burden.

The IHME adopt such definitions by disaggregating to mild, persistent depression (dysthymia) and major depressive disorder (severe).</p><p>All forms of depressive disorder experience some of the following symptoms:</p><ul>
<li>(a) reduced concentration and attention;</li>
<li>(b) reduced self-esteem and self-confidence;</li>
<li>(c) ideas of guilt and unworthiness (even in a mild type of episode);</li>
<li>(d) bleak and pessimistic views of the future;</li>
<li>(e) ideas or acts of self-harm or suicide;</li>
<li>(f) disturbed sleep</li>
<li>(g) diminished appetite.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Mild persistent depression (dysthymia)</strong> tends to have the following diagnostic guidelines:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Depressed mood, loss of interest and enjoyment, and increased fatiguability are usually regarded as the most typical symptoms of depression, and at least two of these, plus at least two of the other symptoms described on page 119 (for F32.-) should usually be present for a definite diagnosis. None of the symptoms should be present to an intense degree. Minimum duration of the whole episode is about 2 weeks. An individual with a mild depressive episode is usually distressed by the symptoms and has some difficulty in continuing with ordinary work and social activities, but will probably not cease to function completely.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Severe depressive disorder</strong> tends to have the following diagnostic guidelines:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;In a severe depressive episode, the sufferer usually shows considerable distress or agitation, unless retardation is a marked feature. Loss of self-esteem or feelings of uselessness or guilt are likely to be prominent, and suicide is a distinct danger in particularly severe cases. It is presumed here that the somatic syndrome will almost always be present in a severe depressive episode. During a severe depressive episode it is very unlikely that the sufferer will be able to continue with social, work, or domestic activities, except to a very limited extent.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The series of charts below present the latest global estimates of the prevalence and disease burden of depressive disorders.

One or more of the following may also be present: self-induced vomiting; self-induced purging; excessive exercise; use of appetite suppressants and/or diuretics;</p><p>(c) There is body-image distortion in the form of a specific psychopathology whereby a dread of fatness persists as an intrusive, overvalued idea and the patient imposes a low weight threshold on himself or herself;</p><p>(d) A widespread endocrine disorder involving the hypothalamic - pituitary - gonadal axis is manifest in women as amenorrhoea and in men as a loss of sexual interest and potency. (An apparent exception is the persistence of vaginal bleeds in anorexic women who are receiving replacement hormonal therapy, most commonly taken as a contraceptive pill.) There may also be elevated levels of growth hormone, raised levels of cortisol, changes in the peripheral metabolism of the thyroid hormone, and abnormalities of insulin secretion;</p><p>(e) If onset is prepubertal, the sequence of pubertal events is delayed or even arrested (growth ceases; in girls the breasts do not develop and there is a primary amenorrhoea; in boys the genitals remain juvenile). With recovery, puberty is often completed normally, but the menarche is late.&quot;</p><p><strong>Bulimia nervosa</strong></p><p>&quot;Bulimia nervosa is an illness defined by repeated behaviours of overeating, preoccupation with control of body weight, and the adoption of extreme measures to mitigate the impacts of overeating.</p><p>For a definite diagnosis, the ICD note that all the following are required:</p><p>(a) There is a persistent preoccupation with eating, and an irresistible craving for food; the patient succumbs to episodes of overeating in which large amounts of food are consumed in short periods of time.</p><p>(b) The patient attempts to counteract the &quot;fattening&quot; effects of food by one or more of the following: self-induced vomiting; purgative abuse, alternating periods of starvation; use of drugs such as appetite suppressants, thyroid preparations or diuretics. When bulimia occurs in diabetic patients they may choose to neglect their insulin treatment.</p><p>(c) The psychopathology consists of a morbid dread of fatness and the patient sets herself or himself a sharply defined weight threshold, well below the premorbid weight that constitutes the optimum or healthy weight in the opinion of the physician. There is often, but not always, a history of an earlier episode of anorexia nervosa, the interval between the two disorders ranging from a few months to several years.

There are always qualitative impairments in reciprocal social interaction. These take the form of an inadequate appreciation of socio-emotional cues, as shown by a lack of responses to other people&apos;s emotions and/or a lack of modulation of behaviour according to social context; poor use of social signals and a weak integration of social, emotional, and communicative behaviours; and, especially, a lack of socio-emotional reciprocity.</p><p>&quot;The condition is also characterized by restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests, and activities. These take the form of a tendency to impose rigidity and routine on a wide range of aspects of day-to day functioning; this usually applies to novel activities as well as to familiar habits and play patterns.&quot;</p><p><strong>Atypical autism</strong></p><p>&apos;Atypical autism&apos; differs from childhood autism either based on the age of onset, or the number of diagnostic criteria which are fulfilled. Those with atypical autism develop the condition after the age of 3 and/or they do not demonstrate behaviours in one or two of the three areas which typically diagnose autism (i.e. reciprocal social interactions, communication, and restrictive, stereotyped, repetitive behaviour).</p><h4 id="prevalence-of-autism"><a class="deep-link" href="#prevalence-of-autism"></a>Prevalence of autism</h4><p>The prevalence of autism typically ranges from 0.2 to 0.5 percent across countries.</p><figure data-grapher-src="/grapher/share-of-the-population-with-autism" class="grapherPreview"><a href="/grapher/share-of-the-population-with-autism" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/share-of-the-population-with-autism_v2_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure><p>Like the full spectrum of autistic spectrum disorders, males are much more likely to have autism than females.

Correlates, Determinants &amp; Consequences</h2><h3 id="risk-factors-for-mental-health"><a class="deep-link" href="#risk-factors-for-mental-health"></a>II.1 Risk factors for mental health</h3><p>The determinants, onset and severity of mental health disorders are complex - they can rarely be attributed to a single factor. The World Health Organization synthesize the potential contributors to mental health and wellbeing into three categories:<a id="ref-4" class="ref" href="#note-4"><sup>4</sup></a></p><ul>
<li>individual attributes and behaviours: these can be particular genetic factors or personality traits;</li>
<li>social and economic circumstances;</li>
<li>environmental factors.</li>
</ul><p>In the table below we see the WHO&apos;s breakdown of potential adverse and protective factors for mental health within these three categories. These factors often interact, compound or negate one another and should therefore not be considered as individual traits or exposures. For example, particular individual traits may make a given person more vulnerable to mental health disorders with the onset of a particular economic or social scenario&#xA0;&#x2014; the instance of one does not necessarily result in a mental health disorder, but combined there is a significantly higher vulnerability.</p><p><div class="tableContainer"><table class="tablepress"><thead><tr><th>Level</th><th>Adverse Factors</th><th>Protective Factors</th></tr></thead><tbody class="row-hover"><tr><td><strong>Individual attributes</strong></td><td>Low self-esteem</td><td>Self-esteem, confidence</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Cognitive/emotional immaturity</td><td>Ability to solve problems &amp; manage stress or adversity</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Difficulties in communicating</td><td>Communication skills</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Medical illness, substance use</td><td>Physical health, fitness</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Social circumstances</strong></td><td>Loneliness, bereavement</td><td>Social support of family &amp; friends</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Neglect, family conflict</td><td>Good parenting/family interaction</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Exposure to violence/abuse</td><td>Physical security &amp; safety</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Low income &amp; poverty</td><td>Economic security</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Difficulties or failure at school</td><td>Scholastic achievement</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Work stress, unemployment</td><td>Satisfaction &amp; success at work</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Environmental factors</strong></td><td>Poor access to basic services</td><td>Equality of access to basic services</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Injustice &amp; discrimination</td><td>Social justice, tolerance, integration</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Social &amp; gender inequalities</td><td>Social &amp; gender equality</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Exposure to war or disaster</td><td>Physical security &amp; safety</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p><h4 id="risk-factors-through-the-life-course"><a class="deep-link" href="#risk-factors-through-the-life-course"></a>Risk factors through the life-course</h4><p>The risk factors and influencers on mental health vary significantly for an individual as they move through the life-course. The following are acknowledged risk factors for a given stage of life.<a id="ref-5" class="ref" href="#note-5"><sup>5</sup></a></p><p><strong>&#x2013; Pre-conception and pre-natal period</strong></p><p>A given individual&apos;s mental health and wellbeing can be influenced by factors present prior to conception or birth. Pregnancies which are unwanted or in adolescence can increase the likelihood of detrimental behaviours of the mother during pregnancy, and the environmental or family conditions of childhood.<a id="ref-6" class="ref" href="#note-6"><sup>6</sup></a> During pregnancy, detrimental behaviours including tobacco, alcohol and drug use can increase the likelihood of later mental health disorders for children; malnutrition, low-birth weight and micronutrient deficiency (for example, iodine deficiency) can also influence later mental health vulnerabilities.<a id="ref-7" class="ref" href="#note-7"><sup>7</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-8" class="ref" href="#note-8"><sup>8</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-9" class="ref" href="#note-9"><sup>9</sup></a></p><p><strong>&#x2013; Infancy and early childhood</strong></p><p>There is a large base of evidence which shows that emotional attachment in early childhood has a considerable impact on later vulnerability to mental health and wellbeing.<a id="ref-10" class="ref" href="#note-10"><sup>10</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a> As a result, particular risk factors include separation from the primary caregiver, in some cases post-natal depression in mothers (which can result in sub-optimal attachment), and parents for whom communication and social interaction is challenging. Child maltreatment and neglect has been found to have a significant impact on vulnerabilities to mental wellbeing.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a> Malnutrition, poor access to basic services and disease and parasites are also important contributors.</p><p><strong>&#x2013; Childhood</strong></p><p>Childhood conditions form a critical component of health and wellbeing later in life. Negative experiences, either at home or outside of the home (for example, bullying in school) can have lifelong impacts on the development of core cognitive and emotional skills. Poor socioeconomic conditions also have a significant effect on vulnerability to mental health disorders; in a study in Sweden, the authors found that children raised in families of poor socioeconomic backgrounds had an increased risk of psychosis.<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a> Poor economic resources, shown through poor housing conditions for example, can be seen by children as shameful or degrading and affect aspects of childhood learning, communication and interaction with peers.</p><p>Children with a parent who has a mental illness or substance use disorder have a higher risk of psychiatric problems themselves.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a id="ref-17" class="ref" href="#note-17"><sup>17</sup></a> This effect between generations can occur as a result of genetic, biological, psychological and social risk factors.</p><p><strong>&#x2013; Adolescence</strong></p><p>Adolescence is typically the stage of life where mental health disorders tend to become more apparent. The risk factors and contributors to wellbeing in childhood apply equally to those in adolescence. In addition, several other contributing factors appear. It is in the years of adolescence that the use of substances including alcohol and drugs first appear.</p><p>Substance use is particularly hazardous and harmful for adolescents because individuals are still developing both mentally and physically. Peer pressure, and media influences also become more prominent over these years. Exposure to substance use is not only an important risk factor for other mental health disorders, but also linked to poorer educational outcomes, more risky sexual behaviour and increased exposure to violence and conflict.</p><p><strong>&#x2013; Adulthood</strong></p><p>Experiences and emotional capabilities developed through childhood and adolescence are important factors in the effect that particular events and scenarios in adulthood have on mental health outcomes.</p><p>The WHO highlight that critical to wellbeing in adulthood is the allocation and balance between work and leisure time. Exposure to high stress and anxiety is strongly influenced by the share of time working, caring for others, or time spent in an insecure economic environment. Individuals with poor socioeconomic security, and in particular unemployment, are also at higher risk to mental health disorders.</p><p>These factors, balanced with the amount of time spent on &apos;consumption&apos; activities, including leisure time and supportive family and friends, often determine the propensity for poor mental health and wellbeing. Community structures can have a significant positive impact on these outcomes&#xA0;&#x2014; individuals who have poor access to such communities, either through social exclusion, neighbourhood violence/crime, or lack of respite care have a higher risk of mental health disorders.</p><p>Physical health also has an important impact on mental wellbeing; an individual&apos;s &apos;physical capital&apos; can influence their sense of esteem and social inclusion. Individuals with chronic illness or disability are at higher risk of poor mental health; this is particularly true for conditions with high rates of stigmatisation, such as HIV/AIDS.</p><p><strong>&#x2013; Older age</strong></p><p>Individuals of older age are of notably high risk of poorer mental health and wellbeing. This typically results from notable changes in life conditions (such as a cease in employment which affects both the feeling of contribution and economic freedom), higher social exclusion, and loneliness. This is particularly true when an older individual begins to lose close family and friends. Bereavement in general is an important predictor of mental health disorders such as depression.</p><p>A decline in physical health can have major impacts on life capabilities by affecting an individual&apos;s mobility and freedom. Older individuals are also at higher risk of abuse or neglect from carers and in some cases, family members.</p><h3 id="link-between-mental-health-and-suicide"><a class="deep-link" href="#link-between-mental-health-and-suicide"></a>II.2 Link between mental health and suicide</h3><p>The link between mental health and substance use disorders and suicide is well-documented.<a id="ref-18" class="ref" href="#note-18"><sup>18</sup></a> It is however true that not all suicides - or suicide attempts - are attributed to underlying mental health or substance use disorders; as shown in the chart below, there is not a direct relationship between mental health prevalence and suicide rates.<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a></p><p>We cover suicide statistics more broadly in our full entry on <a href="/suicide">Suicide</a>, however here we attempt to distil the key findings on the links between mental health and substance use and suicide.

In such cases, understanding the nature of self-harm methods between countries is important; in these countries a high percentage of self-harming behaviours are carried out through more lethal methods such as poisoning (often through pesticides) and self-immolation. This means that in a high number of cases self-harming behaviours can prove fatal, even if there was not a clear intent to die.</p><p>A study by Ferrari et al.

In their meta-study of the mental health-suicide relationship, Ferrari et al. (2015) assess the pooled relative risk of suicide across a range of mental health and substance use disorders.<a id="ref-29" class="ref" href="#note-29"><sup>29</sup></a> This represents the increased risk of suicide for those with a particular mental health or substance use disorder. These results are presented in the table below. As we see, the relative risk is notably higher for some disorders versus others, with high relative risk for those with depression (although with high variability) and schizophrenia.</p><p><div class="tableContainer"><table class="tablepress"><thead><tr><th>Disorder</th><th>Pooled relative risk (95% UI)</th></tr></thead><tbody class="row-hover"><tr><td>Major depressive disorder</td><td>19.9 (9.5-41.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Anxiety disorder</td><td>2.7 (1.7-4.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Schizophrenia</td><td>12.6 (11.0-14.5)</td></tr><tr><td>Bipolar disorder</td><td>5.7 (2.6-12.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Anorexia nervosa</td><td>7.6 (2.2-25.6)</td></tr><tr><td>Alcohol dependence</td><td>9.8 (9.0-10.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Opioid dependence</td><td>6.9 (4.5-10.5)</td></tr><tr><td>Psychostimultant dependence</td><td>8.2 (3.9-16.9)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></p><h3 id="life-satisfaction-and-mental-health"><a class="deep-link" href="#life-satisfaction-and-mental-health"></a>II.3 Life satisfaction and mental health</h3><p>Is the prevalence of mental health disorders reflected in the self-reported life satisfaction or happiness of a given country? Intuitively we may assume that countries with a higher average self-reported life satisfaction would have lower prevalence of mental health disorders. In the chart below we see the relationship between the prevalence of depressive disorders and life satisfaction (measured on a scale of 0 to 10, where 10 is highest).</p><p>Overall we see very little correlation between these two metrics. There is little indication that the more satisfied or &apos;happy&apos; a given country is, the lower the prevalence of depressive disorders. There are a number of reasons why we would expect there to be little relationship. The first is that, as explained in our entry on <a href="/happiness-and-life-satisfaction#are-happiness-averages-really-meaningful" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Happiness and Life Satisfaction</a>, the Cantril ladder measures the <em>aggregate </em>or average&#xA0;life satisfaction of a given country. Since the typical prevalence of depression across countries is approximately 4-5 percent, we may not expect the reported life satisfaction of these individuals to impact significantly on the overall score of a given country.</p><p>Secondly, there is the issue of how accurately self-reported life satisfaction values reflect the actual happiness or life-satisfaction of a given person. It is not improbable that people may lie or exaggerate how satisfied they are with their life. Overall, <a href="/happiness-and-life-satisfaction#can-happiness-really-be-measured" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as we describe</a> in our separate entry, studies have found good correlation between self-reported life satisfaction and particular signals of happiness (such as smiling frequency, smiling with the eyes, sleep quality, nuances in word choice and language, sociability etc.) as well as activity in parts of the brain associated with pleasure and happiness. Nonetheless, because on average, self-reported and signs of happiness/satisfaction correlate well does not necessitate that this is the cases in more specific demographics, such as those with depression or other mental health disorders.</p><figure data-grapher-src="/grapher/depression-vs-self-reported-life-satisfaction" class="grapherPreview"><a href="/grapher/depression-vs-self-reported-life-satisfaction" target="_blank"><div><img src="/exports/depression-vs-self-reported-life-satisfaction_v1_850x600.svg"></div></a></figure></section>

Data Quality, Definitions and Measurement</h2><h3 id="how-is-prevalence-defined-and-measured"><a class="deep-link" href="#how-is-prevalence-defined-and-measured"></a>III.1 How is prevalence defined and measured?</h3><p>The widespread issue of underreporting in mental health reporting means accurate and representative data on the prevalence of disorders is difficult to define. If reliant on mental health diagnoses alone, this underestimation would be severe. Furthermore, prevalence figures would be likely to reflect healthcare spending (which allows for more focus on mental health disorders) rather than giving a representative perspective on differences between countries; high-income countries would likely show significantly higher prevalence as a result of more diagnoses.</p><p>The data presented in this entry by the Institute of Health Metrics &amp; Evaluation (IHME) is therefore based on a combination of sources, including medical and national records, epidemiological data, in addition to survey data. Where raw data for a particular country is scarce, epidemiological data and meta-regression models must be used based on available data from neighbouring countries. Data quality issues are <a href="/mental-health">described below</a>.</p><p>The data presented here therefore offers an&#xA0;<em>estimate</em> (rather than official diagnosis) of mental health prevalence based on medical, epidemiological data, surveys and meta-regression modelling.</p><h3 id="data-availability-on-mental-health"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-availability-on-mental-health"></a>III.2 Data availability on mental health</h3><p>The majority of data presented in this entry is based on estimates from the IHME&apos;s <a href="http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool">Global Burden of Disease</a> (GBD). This is currently one of the only sources which produces global level estimates across most countries on the prevalence and disease burden of mental health and substance use disorders.</p><p>Nonetheless, the GBD acknowledges the clear data gaps which exist on mental health prevalence across the world. Despite being the 5th largest disease burden at a global level (and with within the top three across many countries), detailed data is often lacking. This is particularly true of lower-income countries. The Global Burden of Disease note that the range of epidemiological studies they draw upon for global and national estimates are unequally distributed across disorders, age groups, countries and epidemiological parameters.<a id="ref-30" class="ref" href="#note-30"><sup>30</sup></a> Utilising these studies to provide full coverage of these disorders is challenging.</p><p>To overcome these methodological challenges the authors note:</p><blockquote><p>To deal with this issue and be able to include data derived using various study methodologies and designs, GBD 2013 makes use of DisMod-MR, version 2.0, a Bayesian meta-regression tool. The software makes it possible to pool all of the epidemiological data available for a given disorder into a weighted average, while simultaneously adjusting for known sources of variability in estimates reported across studies. If raw data are not available for a given country, the software produces an imputed estimate for each epidemiological parameter based on data available from surrounding countries. This allowed GBD to include estimates for 188 countries.</p></blockquote></section>
