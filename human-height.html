in May 2019.
<p>The content and structure in the current version do not yet cover all the key aspects we intend to cover. We plan to revise and extend the material in the future.</p></div><p>Human height is determined by a combination of genetics and environmental factors making it an active area of research in both the sciences and social sciences. Recent breakthroughs in sequencing the human genome have allowed identification of 697 genetic variants that influence the height of an individual.<a id="ref-1" class="ref" href="#note-1"><sup>1</sup></a>&#xA0;Although genetics plays an important role in understanding variation within a given population, human growth can be limited by poor childhood nutrition and illness. This makes height strongly correlated with living standards and hence a good proxy for them. Changes to heights over time and within countries paints a picture of economic development. One major advantage of using height as a proxy is the availability of data in the pre-statistical period.</p><p>It is important to stress that height is not used as a direct measure of well-being. In the absence of any abnormality or extremes, we should not expect that changing an individual&#x2019;s height makes them any more or less happy all other things being equal.</p></section>

However, non-genetic, environmental factors during pregnancy, childhood, and adolescence - such as nutrition and health - also have an impact on growth trends. As such, variations in height across the world <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/human-height#what-explains-differences-in-human-height">indicate</a> not only genetic differences, but also general differences in living standards.</p><p>Here, we examine variations in mean male and female heights by country. We use the most recent global study, published by NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) in 2016.<a id="ref-2" class="ref" href="#note-2"><sup>2</sup></a> This dataset was sourced from publicly available measurement surveys &#x2013; such as demographic and health surveys &#x2013; and academic studies. It reports mean height for adults by year of birth, from 1896 to 1996; in other words, people who had reached their eighteenth birthday from 1914 to 2014.</p><p><b>How tall are men across the world?</b></p><p>The global mean height of adult men born in 1996 is 171 centimetres (cm), or 5 foot, and 7.5 inches. There are large variations in average height between nations: the shortest being men in Timor at 160 cm, and the tallest from the Netherlands at 182 cm. This represents a range of 22 cm, or 8 inches.</p><p>There are also clear distinctions between regions. On average, the shortest men can be found in South Asia, where the average height is 165 cm, while the tallest are from Europe and Central Asia, at 177 cm.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-height-of-men" class="grapherPreview">

But how much taller, and how does this vary across the world?</p><p>Globally, the mean height of women is about four and a half inches, or 12 centimeters (cm), shorter than that of men. In the latest available data, the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-height-by-year-of-birth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global mean height</a> for men was 171 cm, versus 159 cm for women.</p><p>Interestingly, this height disparity between the sexes is present everywhere in the world. It&#x2019;s largest in Macedonia, where men are typically 18.5 cm taller than women, and smallest in Gambia, where the mean difference is only 4.5 cm. You can see the absolute difference in mean heights for any country in the world <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/average-height-by-year-of-birth">here</a>.</p><p>The scatter plot below illustrates the difference between the average heights of men and women around the world. It plots average male height on the y-axis, and average female height on the x-axis. The grey line shows where these heights are equal. As we can see, all countries lie above this line; this means that on average, men are taller than women in every country in the world.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mean-height-males-vs-females" class="grapherPreview">

Globally, the ratio is 1.07, meaning that on average, men are about 7% taller than women.</p><p>Across the world, this relative difference between the sexes can vary from only 2 to 3% to over 12%. Regionally, the gap in mean height between men and women is smallest across Sub-Saharan Africa: there, many countries lie below the global average difference of 7%.</p><p>Curiously, the global ratio &#x2013; around 1.07 &#x2013; has remained pretty much constant since the data began in 1896 despite large increases in absolute terms in the average heights of both men and women.</p><p>Despite a relatively consistent ratio at the global level, some countries have seen significant changes. A century ago, South Korean males were on average 18 cm taller than their female counterparts; this difference has fallen to 13 cm, meaning that South Korean women have seen larger absolute gains in height than South Korean men. By contrast, in the Philippines this difference has doubled from 7 cm to 14 cm, meaning that average height of Filipino men has increased faster than that of Filipino women.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/male-to-female-height-ratio" class="grapherPreview">

This threshold is defined by overall consumption (how many calories we eat), as well as the intake of high-quality animal proteins and micronutrients.<a id="ref-11" class="ref" href="#note-11"><sup>11</sup></a> This means both the quantity and diversity of diets are important. As such, poor nutrition is associated with <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment#undernourishment-of-children">stunted growth</a>.</p><p>A study by Headey (2018) of dietary patterns in lower-income countries suggests there is a strong association between the consumption of animal sourced foods and height.<a id="ref-12" class="ref" href="#note-12"><sup>12</sup></a> For instance, animal proteins comprise 9.5% of energy intake in Madagascar, where the average male height is 161.5 cm; Botswanans get 12.5% of their calories from animal proteins, and the men are 10 cm taller on average. But even larger height disparities begin to arise at high levels of animal protein intake.</p><p>In high-income countries, where animal protein intake is high, Grasgruber (2014) found that the strongest predictor of male height is the ratio of high-quality animal proteins - from milk products, red meat, and fish - to low-quality plant proteins - from wheat, rice and other cereals.<a id="ref-13" class="ref" href="#note-13"><sup>13</sup></a> This could explain why some countries with very high socioeconomic status have shorter heights than we&#x2019;d expect. Consider the difference between South Korea and the Netherlands: both have a very high HDI &#x2013; over 0.9 &#x2013; but the Dutch are nearly 8 centimeters taller (182.5 cm versus 175 cm). What separates them is their intake of animal protein: the Netherlands&#x2019; animal:plant protein ratio is 2.16 versus only 0.69 in South Korea.</p><p>Animal proteins form an <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/diet-compositions#animal-based-foods-form-a-larger-part-of-our-diet-as-we-get-richer">increasingly</a> large part of our diets as income increases. Since nutrition plays a key role in determining height, there is an obvious relationship between income and height.<a id="ref-14" class="ref" href="#note-14"><sup>14</sup></a> A high level of socioeconomic development therefore predicts taller average heights.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-calories-from-animal-protein-vs-mean-male-height" class="grapherPreview">

Disease during childhood restricts growth, because it reduces the availability of nutrients and raises metabolic requirements.<a id="ref-15" class="ref" href="#note-15"><sup>15</sup></a> Children fighting disease have higher nutritional requirements during a period when nutrients are less available. As such, high incidences of disease should lead to shorter average heights.</p><p>Grasgruber (2016)&#xA0;found that the socioeconomic factor most strongly correlated with male height is child mortality. This relationship is illustrated by the scatter plot below, with child mortality rate on the y-axis and mean male height on the x-axis.<a id="ref-16" class="ref" href="#note-16"><sup>16</sup></a> A low child mortality rate suggests low incidences of disease, as well as sufficient nourishment, and hence predicts a taller average height. For example, 0.2% of children in Finland die before they are 5 years old compared to 7.4% of children in Afghanistan; the average male heights are 180 cm and 165 cm respectively.</p><p>The relationship between health and height is reinforced by the significant impact of healthcare expenditure. We see this reflected in Arab states where health expenditure is much lower than their GDP would predict. For example, compare Oman and the Netherlands: the average male height of the Dutch is 182cm &#x2013; 13 centimeters taller than the average in Oman. Both countries have high levels of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/maddison-data-gdp-per-capita-in-2011us?tab=chart&amp;time=1950..2016&amp;country=NLD+OMN">GDP per capita</a>. But the Netherlands spends much more on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-healthcare-expenditure-per-capita?tab=chart&amp;time=1995..2014&amp;country=NLD+OMN">healthcare</a>: healthcare expenditure per capita in Oman is $1,442, or 3.7% of GDP versus $5,202, or 9.2% of GDP in the Netherlands.</p><p>Both child mortality and healthcare expenditure impact life expectancy: we would therefore expect them to be strong determinants of the relationship between standard of living and average height.</p><p>Total fertility (the children per woman) also interacts with these determinants, making it the second strongest socioeconomic correlate of height. The role of fertility in high-income countries is marginal, since fertility rates are already very low. But it gains statistical significance at lower incomes, where fertility rates are relatively high. In families where there are a large number of children, expenditure and food availability for each child is often lower. We might therefore expect that in countries where the fertility rate is high, health expenditure and nutritional quality per child is low, while incidence of disease is high.</p><figure data-grapher-src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-rate-vs-mean-male-height-cm" class="grapherPreview">

This could help to explain disparities in average heights around the world. Certain haplogroups - groups of variant clusters that are inherited from one common ancestor - have observable associations with height.</p><p>For example, one haplogroup (J1-M267) is most commonly observed in populations that spread from the Zagros mountains in Iran to the Arabian peninsula, particularly Yemen.<a id="ref-19" class="ref" href="#note-19"><sup>19</sup></a> Another haplogroup (R1b-S116) is often found in populations from Ireland, Britain, France, and Iberia, who probably spread from the Franco-Cantabrian region.<a id="ref-20" class="ref" href="#note-20"><sup>20</sup></a> These haplogroups are associated with short stature.</p><p>By contrast, one haplogroup (I-M170) is most concentrated in Germanic-speaking Europe, and the Western Balkans, particularly Herzegovina.<a id="ref-21" class="ref" href="#note-21"><sup>21</sup></a>&#xA0;These regions are characterised by tallness, which strongly suggests a correlation between this haplogroup and height.</p><h3 id="is-height-determined-by-nature-or-nurture"><a class="deep-link" href="#is-height-determined-by-nature-or-nurture"></a>Is height determined by nature or nurture?</h3><p>Is height determined by genetics or environment? The short answer is that it depends on the countries you are comparing. Differences in average heights could be due to different genes, different environments, or - more likely - some combination of both.</p><p>For instance, the average male height in Bosnia and Herzegovina is 181 cm &#x2013; far higher than the global mean of 171 cm, and even the regional mean of 177 cm. This height cannot be explained by high standards of living nor high animal protein consumption: its HDI is one of the lowest in Europe, and the ratio of animal protein to plant protein consumption is only 0.33, compared to 2.16 in the Netherlands. The cause in this case must be genetic: nature over nurture.</p><p>Differences in average heights between North and South Korea tell a very different story, as told by Pak (2005).<a id="ref-22" class="ref" href="#note-22"><sup>22</sup></a> The two halves of the Korean Peninsula share a genetic lineage, but since the partition in 1945, there has been a great divergence in average heights. While the average height of South Korean men in the dataset increased by 3.8 cm - one of the largest increases in the world - North Korean men of comparable ages grew only 0.8 cm. This disparity is clearly due to differences in standards of living: nurture over nature.</p><p>The equation that determines human height is made up of many components. No single factor can predict height at an individual or even a national level. But overall, average heights can offer a unique insight into the genetic makeup and standard of living of a population.</p></section>





























<section><h2 id="data-quality-definition"><a class="deep-link" href="#data-quality-definition"></a>Data Quality &amp; Definition</h2><p>Accurately measuring the height of an individual is a straightforward task and so we should be confident that there is&#xA0;relatively little measurement error in the recorded data. This is unlikely to be the case when measuring the height of skeletons. What is more, the techniques used to date skeletal remains (such as radio carbon dating) only provide a probabilistic estimate.</p><p>Another factor to consider is the potential sample bias from the historical sources. Since the height data is&#xA0;largely composed of soldiers, criminals, salves and servants, these groups may not be representative of the wider population. This problem has been highlighted by academics researching human height.<a id="ref-23" class="ref" href="#note-23"><sup>23</sup></a> In fact, the observed drop in height during the industrial revolution -- usually attributed to the negative health impacts of industrialisation -- can be explained by the labour market conditions that existed at the time. They argue that &quot;as economies grew, tight labour markets discouraged military enlistments by the most productive workers, with those enlisting (and being measured) increasingly over-representing the less advantaged members of society.&quot;</p><p>By comparing the heights of soldiers in the US army with countries that enforced conscription we can see the bias more clearly.
