This needs to change and over the last weeks Daniel and Jaiden &#x2013; our two web developers in the team &#x2013; together with the rest of the team have made our plans for how to restructure our content and discussed what our redesign should achieve. But we are not designers and this is why we are reaching out.</p><p>We know this is a very long shot, but we have some hope that there might be a designer out there who knows our work, is (very?) annoyed by our poor choice of fonts, colors, and structure, and happens to be interested in working with us now.</p><p>We cannot employ a designer full-time, but we have a budget to pay you for your work as a freelancer. If you are interested we would like to work with you closely for the next 2-4 weeks.</p><p>There is one problem for us right now: Usually we take a lot of time to work on a big project like this, but currently we can&apos;t and&#xA0;we need someone who can start very soon, ideally this week.</p><p>Remote work is possible (for the time-zone you should know that we are currently based in Silicon Valley).&#xA0;Since it is urgent full time would be ideal, but if someone is exceptionally good and fast it might not have to be full time.</p><p>Below, we&apos;ve tried to outline what we think we need and we&apos;ve linked to some sketches we&apos;ve made. If you have thoughts on our redesign we very much appreciate if you share them with us. We welcome all feedback &#x2013; big or small &#x2013; about what we could be doing better. Also, feel free to email if you have any questions.</p><p>If you want to work with us, or you know someone who might want, please get in touch with me at <strong><a href="mailto:max@ourworldindata.org">max@ourworldindata.org</a></strong>. Tell us why you are the right person to work with us on this and from when to when you can focus on this work. And if you have done relevant work in the past or you have concrete ideas please share them with us.</p></section>






<section><h2 id="goals"><a class="deep-link" href="#goals"></a>Goals</h2><p>Our overarching goals with the redesign are to:</p><ol>
<li>Define a <strong>consistent visual design</strong> across our site</li>
<li>Make it easier to <strong>find all our content</strong></li>
<li>Make it clearer <strong>who we are</strong></li>
<li>Provide more layout options for our <strong>entry content</strong> (we&apos;d like to have the option to embed large visualisations or put explanations alongside charts)</li>
</ol><p>In the team we&apos;ve had good discussions around this in the last few weeks and we&apos;ve settled on a lot structural things for the website that address points 1, 2, and 3 in this list. It would&apos;ve been helpful to have a designer involved at all stages, but due to our short timeframe, <strong>we primarily need someone to help us come up with a consistent visual design</strong> (fonts, colors, icons, a bit of layout) and potentially a new logo.</p></section>



<section><h2 id="architecture"><a class="deep-link" href="#architecture"></a>Architecture</h2><p>The pages we will be updating or creating are:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Homepage</strong> which will now contain more about us (explained below)</li>
<li><strong>Entry page</strong> (100+) function and structure are explained below</li>
<li><strong>Blog posts</strong> (120+) which we will split into two categories:
<ul>
<li><strong>Daily updates and facts</strong> that highlight a specific fact or an update we made to an entry.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly explainers</strong> which are more in-depth articles of about 1-3 pages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>About</strong>
<ul>
<li>We will add sub-navigation and split this into more pages (Mission, Sponsors, Audience, Choosing data sources, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong> overlay, which is a new instant search we are implementing</li>
<li><strong>Index</strong> which is a new page that will list <em>all</em> our content (all entries, posts and charts)</li>
</ul></section>


<section><h2 id="branding-visual-design"><a class="deep-link" href="#branding-visual-design"></a>Branding &amp; visual design</h2><p>As we mentioned, this is what we primarily need help with in a short timeframe.</p><h3 id="aesthetics"><a class="deep-link" href="#aesthetics"></a>Aesthetics</h3><p>We want a visual design that makes use the <strong>interactive</strong> <strong>capabilities of the web</strong> and at the same time has the <strong>aesthetics of research publications</strong> &#x2013; books and research papers &#x2013; in which tradition we stand.</p><p>The links below are examples of a design from old books and atlases &#x2013; we think this aesthetic could work well for our publication. We have tried to connect to this tradition before (e.g. in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/a-history-of-global-living-conditions-in-5-charts#why-do-we-not-know-how-our-world-is-changing">our most widely shared graph</a>).</p><p>Some examples we like:</p><ul>
<li>Reproduction of <a href="https://www.c82.net/euclid/">The Elements of Euclid</a></li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/accurat/">information design of Accurat</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wpage.unina.it/agodemar/DSV-DQV/DSV-DQV_Quaderno_1.pdf">Nice research paper layout</a> (on planes in Italian; as an example)</li>
<li><a href="https://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/SaezZucman2016QJE.pdf">QJE layout</a> (as an example of how a typical classic research paper looks like)</li>
<li><a href="https://homepage.univie.ac.at/noichlm94/img/struct_phil_iii/full_struct.pdf">Philosophy map</a> (with many elements of classic book design)</li>
<li>More: aesthetics of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=geological+maps+old&amp;tbm=isch">old geological maps</a>&#xA0;(and <a href="http://www.radicalcartography.net/index.html?fisk">Fisk&apos;s maps</a> of the Mississippi), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Map-World-According-Illustrators-Storytellers/dp/3899554698">this book cover</a>, <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2015/06/16/reviving-the-statistical-atlas-of-the-united-states-with-new-data/">Nathan Yau&#x2019;s redesign</a> of the US 19th century census.</li>
</ul><h3 id="logo-colors"><a class="deep-link" href="#logo-colors"></a>Logo &amp; colors</h3><div style="float: right;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GIyr_w-b_.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-22416" src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/01/GIyr_w-b_400x400.jpg" alt="Giyr w b " width="130" height="130" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GIyr_w-b_400x400.jpg 400w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></div><p>It would be nice if the logo was more <strong>symbolic</strong> of our work and would also work well in black and white.</p><p>The current logo is used on all our charts which are embedded all over the web and we would like the new logo to be recognizable to people who are familiar with the current one, as it is impossible to change it on those charts that are out there and which will likely stick around for a long time. We want to keep <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Blue_(colour)">this</a> shade of blue. But the kerning of the letters and the placement of the text in the logo need to be fixed.</p><div style="float: right; clear: right;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/planet-earth-logo-1.png" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone wp-image-22415" src="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/01/planet-earth-logo-1.png" alt="Planet earth logo 1" width="130" height="78" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/planet-earth-logo-1-150x90.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/01/planet-earth-logo-1.png 364w" sizes="(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"></a></div><p>We came up with this world arc logo &#x2013; which is mimicked in our redesign of the homepage header &#x2013; but we would like to see more ideas.</p><h3 id="fonts"><a class="deep-link" href="#fonts"></a>Fonts</h3><p>We currently use Georgia and the default sans-serif system font. We are looking to change these &#x2013; though we still think it makes sense to have two fonts: <strong>one serif</strong> and <strong>one sans-serif. </strong>This is also how all our static charts look; they have Georgia headings and Helvetica Neue within the chart. This also makes clear that we have not been consistent over time and across the site and static visualizations.</p><p>We currently only use a serif font in headings &#x2013; we would like to use it more widely, to visually connect to the tradition of books and research papers. We are not quite sure if it makes sense to use a serif font for main text &#x2013; we don&apos;t think so, but we would like to hear some opinions on this.</p><p>Buying a font is unfortunately not an option for us &#x2013; it would be complicated due to our charts being embedded all over the web, across many domains. We would like to continue to use free fonts.</p><p>Some Google Fonts that we like:</p><ul>
<li>Merriweather, Lora, Libre Baskerville, Domine for the serif;</li>
<li>Source Sans Pro, Libre Franklin for sans-serif.</li>
</ul><p>One requirement is that we&apos;d like the font to have unicode characters for subscripts, so we can have titles like &quot;CO&#x2082; and other Greenhouse Gas Emissions&quot;.</p></section>



















<section><h2 id="pages"><a class="deep-link" href="#pages"></a>Pages</h2><p>The two pages that need most attention in the coming weeks are the <strong>homepage</strong> and the <strong>entry page</strong>.</p><h3 id="homepage"><a class="deep-link" href="#homepage"></a>Homepage</h3><p>The homepage is the first impression and is a major focus of our redesign. We have made a <strong>design draft for the homepage in Figma</strong> (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/01/Homepage-structure.png">PNG here</a>, <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/C7oaejWwJ9HFjO1QWzaN5210/Homepage-v1-%E2%80%93-22-Jan-2019?node-id=0%3A1">Figma here</a>). We are fairly certain about the overall structure of the page (what goes where), but are looking for help with the <strong>visual design</strong>.</p><p>One of our challenges is to visually differentiate between the different types of content we have &#x2013; entries, blog posts, and charts. Another challenge is that we have a lot of content &#x2013; 100 entries, 120 blog posts and more than 2000 charts &#x2013; far too much to list on a single page.</p><h3 id="entry-page"><a class="deep-link" href="#entry-page"></a>Entry page</h3><p>Entries are long-form articles that give a comprehensive overview of the world&#x2019;s development on a specific topic &#x2013; we write how the world has changed, why it has changed, and why it matters. As examples, you can see our entries on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty">Extreme poverty</a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions">CO2 emissions</a> or <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/trade-and-globalization">Trade</a>. We have around 100 entries written so far and in the future will have at least 200 (see our <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/about/list-of-all-data-entries">list of all future entries</a>).</p><p>We have made a sketch (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/01/Entry-contents.png">PNG here</a>, <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/UjxCcGukr9Af3ZYlRW9EWp4p/Entry-v1-%E2%80%93-22-Jan-2019?node-id=1%3A2">Figma here</a>) of the content that we plan to add to entries.</p><p>With the redesign, we want entries to be <strong>starting points to find all related content</strong> about the topic &#x2013; the reader should find links to all blog posts and charts on the same topic.</p><p>We would also like to be more <strong>flexible with the layout</strong> of the entry content &#x2013; we should be able to feature a visualisation in full-width (e.g. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality#child-mortality-globally-post-1950">this</a> one), put charts side by side (e.g. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth#births-and-deaths">these two</a>) or provide explanations alongside charts. We currently always restrict visualisations to the width of the text.</p></section>









<section><h2 id="navigation"><a class="deep-link" href="#navigation"></a>Navigation</h2><p>As our site grows, things have been getting hard to find, even for us as authors. To tackle this, we are:</p><ul>
<li>building our own <strong>custom instant search</strong> to search all our content (currently we redirect people to a google search)</li>
<li>switching to an <strong>Amazon-style <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/01/Screenshot-2019-01-22-at-15.11.22.png">dropdown menu</a></strong> for the collection of topics</li>
<li>building an <strong>Index page</strong> to give our readers an overview of all our content (this page will be very long)</li>
</ul><p>We are still working out the specifics of what we can do and how we present the items on the search and Index page.</p><p>One thing we need help with is finding other ways to fit all the links in the main navigation from our Figma sketch of the homepage. We would like to add Newsletter and one or two other links at some point &#x2013; is there some layout that makes more sense?</p><h3 id="sub-navigation"><a class="deep-link" href="#sub-navigation"></a>Sub-navigation</h3><p>For the About page, we also need to have a sub-navigation. We will have separate pages about our mission, how we choose data, entries we want to write, etc. This will be 7-9 links (we haven&apos;t yet decided on the wording).</p><p>If you can help us, get in touch. We look forward working with you!</p></section>
